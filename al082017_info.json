Gert is moving\nquickly toward the northeast near 31 mph (50 km/h).  An even faster\nmotion toward the east-northeast is expected through Thursday,\nfollowed by some deceleration and a turn toward the northeast\nThursday night and Friday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through\ntonight, but weakening is forecast to begin on Thursday.  Gert\nshould become an extratropical low by early Friday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the\ncenter, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140\nmiles (220 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Gert will spread northward along the\neast coast of the United States from Virginia northward to\nNew England and Atlantic Canada during the next day or two.\nSwells are also expected to continue to affect Bermuda through\ntonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and\nrip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local\nweather forecast office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
