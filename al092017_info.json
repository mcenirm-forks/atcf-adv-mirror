For a depiction\nof areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm\nSurge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a\nlife-threatening situation.

Preparations to protect life and property should be\nrushed to completion.\n\nA Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-\nthreatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the\ncoastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.\n\nA Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible\nwithin the watch area.\n\nIn addition, interests in southwestern Louisiana should continue to\nmonitor the progress of this system.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United\nStates, including possible inland watches and warnings, please\nmonitor products issued by your local National Weather Service\nforecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside\nthe United States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Harvey was located\nnear latitude 25.6 North, longitude 95.1 West. Harvey is moving\ntoward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general\nmotion is expected to continue with a decrease in forward speed\nduring the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, Harvey will\napproach the middle Texas coast later today and make landfall Friday\nnight or early Saturday.  Harvey is then likely to stall near or\njust inland of the middle Texas coast through the weekend.\n\nReports from Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter planes indicate\nthat the maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165\nkm/h) with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible,\nand Harvey is expected to become a major hurricane before it reaches\nthe middle Texas coast.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105\nmiles (165 km).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure recently reported by both\nreconnaissance planes was 967 mb (28.56 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 15 to 25 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 35 inches over\nthe middle and upper Texas coast through next Wednesday.  During\nthe same time period Harvey is expected to produce total rain\naccumulations of 7 to 15 inches in far south Texas and the Texas\nHill Country eastward through central and southwest Louisiana, with\naccumulations of up to 7 inches extending into other parts of Texas\nand the lower Mississippi Valley. Rainfall from Harvey will cause\ndevastating and life-threatening flooding.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nN Entrance Padre Island Natl Seashore to Sargent...6 to 12 ft\nSargent to Jamaica Beach...5 to 8 ft\nPort Mansfield to N Entrance Padre Island Natl Seashore...5 to 7 ft\nJamaica Beach to High Island...2 to 4 ft\nMouth of the Rio Grande to Port Mansfield...2 to 4 ft\nHigh Island to Morgan City...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe northeast of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding\ndepends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and\ncan vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to\nyour area, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are likely within the hurricane warning\narea late Friday and Friday night, with tropical storm conditions\nexpected to first reach the coast in the hurricane warning area\nlater this morning.  These conditions are likely to persist\ninto Saturday in portions of the hurricane and tropical storm\nwarning area.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey will begin to affect the\nTexas, Louisiana, and northeast Mexico coasts later this morning.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions. Please consult products from your local weather\noffice.\n\nTORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes are possible across portions of the\nmiddle and upper Texas coast on Friday.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
