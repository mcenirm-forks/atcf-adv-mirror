For a depiction of areas at risk, please see\nthe National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,\navailable at hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.\n\nA Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected\nsomewhere within the warning area.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning.\n\nInterests in southwestern Louisiana should continue to monitor the\nprogress of this system.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, including possible\ninland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your\nlocal National Weather Service forecast office.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Harvey was located by\nNOAA Doppler radar near latitude 28.7 North, longitude 97.2 West.\nHarvey is moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).\nHarvey is expected to slow down through the day and meander over\nsoutheastern Texas through the middle of next week.\n\nDoppler radar data indicate that maximum sustained winds have\ndecreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts. These winds\nare confined to a small area near the eye of the hurricane.\nAdditional weakening is forecast, and Harvey is likely to become a\ntropical storm later today.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from\nthe center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140\nmiles (220 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.79 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n15 to 30 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 40 inches over the\nmiddle and upper Texas coast through next Wednesday. During the same\ntime period Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 5 to 15 inches in far south Texas, the Texas Hill Country\nand southwest and central Louisiana. Rainfall of this magnitude\nwill cause catastrophic and life-threatening flooding.  A list of\nrainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather Prediction Center\ncan be found at: www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nPort Aransas to Port O'Connor...6 to 12 ft\nPort O'Connor to Sargent...6 to 9 ft\nSargent to Jamaica Beach...4 to 6 ft\nBaffin Bay to Port Aransas...3 to 6 ft\nJamaica Beach to High Island...2 to 4 ft\nMouth of the Rio Grande to Port Mansfield...1 to 3 ft\nHigh Island to Morgan City...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the\narea of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large\nand destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the\nrelative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary\ngreatly over short distances.  For information specific to your\narea, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are occuring inland from the coast\nwithin Harvey's eyewall, and hurricane-force winds, especially in\ngusts, are still possible near the middle Texas coast for the next\nseveral hours.  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in other\nportions of the hurricane and tropical storm warning areas.\nTropical storm conditions are likely to persist along portions of\nthe coast through at least Sunday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the Texas,\nLouisiana, and northeast Mexico coasts.  These swells are likely to\ncause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please\nconsult products from your local weather office.\n\nTORNADOES:  Tornadoes are possible today and tonight near the middle\nand upper Texas coast into far southwest Louisiana.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
