Please see warnings and other products issued by your\nlocal National Weather Service office for additional information on\nthis life-threatening situation.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are\npossible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nInterests elsewhere along the middle and upper Texas coast and in\nsouthern Louisiana should continue to monitor the progress of\nHarvey.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, including possible\ninland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your\nlocal National Weather Service forecast office.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was\nlocated near latitude 28.5 North, longitude 96.0 West. Harvey is\nmoving toward the southeast near 5 mph (7 km/h), and a slow motion\ntoward the southeast is expected through tonight.  A gradual turn\ntoward the northeast and a continued slow forward speed are expected\nTuesday and Tuesday night.  On the forecast track, the center of\nHarvey is expected to be just offshore of the middle and upper\ncoasts of Texas through Tuesday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.\nSome slow intensification is possible during the next 48 hours.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)\nmainly to the east of the center.\n\nThe minimum central pressure estimated from surface observations\nalong the Texas coast is 997 mb (29.44 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall\naccumulations of 15 to 25 inches through Friday over the upper Texas\ncoast and into southwestern Louisiana.  Isolated storm totals may\nreach 50 inches over the upper Texas coast, including the Houston/\nGalveston metropolitan area.  These rains are currently producing\ncatastrophic and life-threatening flooding over large portions\nof southeastern Texas.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE AFFECTED\nAREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE PLACE.  DO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED\nROADWAYS. Please see warnings and products issued by your local\nNational Weather Service office for additional information on this\nlife-threatening situation.\n\nElsewhere, Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n5 to 15 inches farther south into the middle Texas coast and farther\neast across south-central Louisiana.  Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10\ninches are expected in southeast Louisiana.\n\nA list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather\nPrediction Center can be found at:\nwww.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nPort Aransas to Morgan City including Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the\narea of onshore winds.  Surge-related flooding depends on the\nrelative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary\ngreatly over short distances.  For information specific to your\narea, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in rain bands well to\nthe east of the center of Harvey, including portions of the tropical\nstorm warning area along the coast.  Tropical storm conditions are\nlikely to persist in areas of onshore winds within the warning area\nduring the next couple of days, and are possible in the watch area\nby Wednesday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the coasts of Texas\nand Louisiana.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening\nsurf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your\nlocal weather office.\n\nTORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight from\nextreme southeast Texas across parts of southern Louisiana.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Beven\n\nNNNN",
