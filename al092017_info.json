Please see warnings\nand other products issued by your local National Weather Service\noffice for additional information on this life-threatening\nsituation.\n\nA Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening\ninundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,\nduring the next 12 to 24 hours in the indicated locations.  For a\ndepiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather\nService Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at\nhurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons\nlocated within these areas should take all necessary actions to\nprotect life and property from rising water and the potential for\nother dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other\ninstructions from local officials.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, including possible\ninland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your\nlocal National Weather Service forecast office.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was\nlocated near latitude 29.2 North, longitude 93.5 West.  Harvey is\nmoving toward the northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A north-\nnortheastward motion is expected later this morning, and this\ngeneral motion should continue through tonight.  On the forecast\ntrack, the center of Harvey is expected to move inland over the\nnorthwestern Gulf Coast within the tropical storm warning area\nlater this morning.\n\nSatellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds\nare near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.  No significant change\nin strength is anticipated before the center crosses the coast, but\ngradual weakening should begin thereafter.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)\nfrom the center.  A wind gust to 51 mph (82 km/h) was recently\nmeasured by a National Ocean Service station at Sabine Pass North,\nTexas.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.38 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall\naccumulations of 6 to 12 inches to the north and east of Houston\nfrom far east Texas into southwestern Louisiana.  Isolated storm\ntotals will reach 50 inches over the upper Texas coast, including\nthe Houston/Galveston metropolitan area.  These rains are currently\nproducing catastrophic and life-threatening flooding over large\nportions of southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana.  DO NOT\nATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE AFFECTED AREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE PLACE.\nDO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED ROADWAYS.  Please see warnings and\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service office for\nadditional information on this life-threatening situation.\n\nElsewhere, Harvey is expected to produce total rainfall amounts of 5\nto 10 inches across portions of southern Louisiana into coastal\nMississippi and Alabama.  Rainfall associated with Harvey will\nspread northward by mid to late week, with rainfall amounts of 4 to\n8 inches spreading into portions of Arkansas and the Tennessee\nValley.\n\nA list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather\nPrediction Center can be found at:\nwww.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nHolly Beach to Morgan City...2 to 4 ft\nSan Luis Pass to west of Holly Beach incl. Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft\nMorgan City to Grand Isle...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the\narea of onshore winds. Surge-related flooding depends on the\nrelative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary\ngreatly over short distances. For information specific to your\narea, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of\nthe warning area along the coast and are likely to persist through\ntoday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are still affecting the coasts of\nTexas and Louisiana.  These swells are likely to cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\nTORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through Wednesday across\nparts of Louisiana, Mississippi, southern Alabama, and southeast\nArkansas.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
