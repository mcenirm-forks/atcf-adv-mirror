Please see warnings and other products\nissued by your local National Weather Service office for additional\ninformation on this life-threatening situation.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, including possible\ninland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your\nlocal National Weather Service forecast office.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was\nlocated near latitude 29.0 North, longitude 97.2 West. Harvey is\nmoving toward the southeast near 2 mph (4 km/h), and a slow\nsoutheastward to east-southeastward motion is expected over the next\ncouple of days.  On the forecast track, the center will move very\nnear the coast of southeastern Texas on Monday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher\ngusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48\nhours.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)\nprimarily over water to the east and northeast of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall\naccumulations of 15 to 25 inches through Friday over the middle and\nupper Texas coast, including the Houston/Galveston metropolitan\narea. Isolated storm totals may reach 50 inches in this region.\nThese rains are currently producing catastrophic and life-\nthreatening flooding, and flash flood emergencies are in effect\nfor portions of southeastern Texas. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE\nAFFECTED AREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE PLACE. DO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED\nROADWAYS.  Please see warnings and other products issued by your\nlocal National Weather Service office for additional information on\nthis dire and life-threatening situation.\n\nElsewhere, Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 5 to 15 inches farther south toward the lower Texas coast,\nfarther west toward the Texas Hill Country, and farther east\nthrough southwest and central Louisiana.\n\nA list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather\nPrediction Center can be found at:\nwww.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nPort Aransas to High Island including Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft\nHigh Island to Morgan City...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the\narea of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large\nand destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the\nrelative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary\ngreatly over short distances.  For information specific to your\narea, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in an area near the\ncenter and over portions of the tropical storm warning area along\nthe coast.  Tropical storm conditions are likely to persist in\nareas of onshore flow within the warning area during the next day\nor so.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the coasts of Texas\nand Louisiana.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening\nsurf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your\nlocal weather office.\n\nTORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight near\nthe middle and upper Texas coast into southwest Louisiana.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
