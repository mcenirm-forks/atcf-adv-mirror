Harvey is moving toward the north-northwest\nnear 10 mph (17 km/h). A track toward the northwest or\nnorth-northwest at a faster forward speed is expected for the next\n48 hours.  On the forecast track, Harvey will approach the southern\nTexas coast on Friday.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve aircraft reports that the maximum sustained\nwinds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.\nAdditional strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and\nHarvey is expected to become a hurricane by Friday.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)\nfrom the center.\n\nThe minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force\nHurricane Hunter aircraft is 986 mb (29.12 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n10 to 15 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches over the\nTexas coast through next Wednesday. During the same time period\nHarvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3 to 9\ninches along its outer radius including parts of south, central, and\neastern Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley. Rainfall from Harvey\nmay cause life-threatening flooding.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nPort Mansfield to San Luis Pass...5 to 7 ft\nSan Luis Pass to High Island...2 to 4 ft\nMouth of the Rio Grande to Port Mansfield...2 to 4 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe northeast of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding\ndepends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and\ncan vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to\nyour area, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are likely within the hurricane warning\narea late Friday or Friday night, with tropical storm conditions\nexpected to first reach the coast in the hurricane warning area\nFriday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are likely to affect the Texas,\nLouisiana, and northeast Mexico coasts by Friday.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
