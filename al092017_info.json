A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are\npossible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nInterests in southwestern Louisiana should continue to monitor the\nprogress of this system.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United States,\nincluding possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice. For storm information specific to your area outside the\nUnited States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Harvey\nwas located near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 92.6 West. The\ndepression is moving toward the northwest near 2 mph (4 km/h).\nA track toward the northwest or north-northwest at a faster forward\nspeed is expected for the next 48 hours.  On the forecast track,\nHarvey should be approaching the Texas coast late Friday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and\nHarvey could become a hurricane on Friday.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n10 to 15 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches over the\nmiddle and upper Texas coast and southwest Louisiana through next\nTuesday, with heavy rainfall beginning as early as Friday morning.\nHarvey is also expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3 to\n9 inches in portions of south, central, and northeast Texas and the\nrest of the lower Mississippi Valley. Rainfall from Harvey could\ncause life-threatening flooding.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nPort Mansfield to High Island...4 to 6 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe northeast of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding\ndepends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and\ncan vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to\nyour area, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch\narea by late Friday, with tropical storm conditions possible by\nearly Friday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are likely to affect the Texas,\nLouisiana, and northeast Mexico coasts by Friday.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
