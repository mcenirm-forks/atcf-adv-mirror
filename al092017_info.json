For a depiction\nof areas at risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm\nSurge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a\nlife-threatening situation.  Persons located within these areas\nshould take all necessary actions to protect life and property from\nrising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\nPromptly follow evacuation and other instructions from local\nofficials.\n\nA Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected\nsomewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued\n36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-\nforce winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.  Preparations to protect life and property should be\nrushed to completion.\n\nA Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-\nthreatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the\ncoastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.\n\nA Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible\nwithin the watch area.\n\nIn addition, interests in southwestern Louisiana should continue to\nmonitor the progress of this system.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United\nStates, including possible inland watches and warnings, please\nmonitor products issued by your local National Weather Service\nforecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside\nthe United States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Harvey was\nlocated near latitude 25.2 North, longitude 94.6 West. Harvey is\nmoving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  This general\nmotion is expected to continue with a decrease in forward speed\nduring the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, Harvey will\napproach the middle Texas coast on Friday and make landfall Friday\nnight or early Saturday.  Harvey is then likely to stall near or\njust inland of the middle Texas coast through the weekend.\n\nReports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft\nindicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 85 mph (140 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  While Harvey has changed little in strength over\nthe past several hours, strengthening is expected to resume later\ntonight, and Harvey is expected to become a major hurricane by\nFriday before it reaches the middle Texas coast.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles\n(165 km).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane\nHunter aircraft is 973 mb (28.74 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 15 to 25 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 35 inches over\nthe middle and upper Texas coast through next Wednesday.  During\nthe same time period Harvey is expected to produce total rain\naccumulations of 7 to 15 inches in far south Texas and the Texas\nHill Country eastward through central and southwest Louisiana, with\naccumulations of up to 7 inches extending into other parts of Texas\nand the lower Mississippi Valley. Rainfall from Harvey will cause\ndevastating and life-threatening flooding.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nN Entrance Padre Island Natl Seashore to Sargent...6 to 12 ft\nSargent to Jamaica Beach...5 to 8 ft\nPort Mansfield to N Entrance Padre Island Natl Seashore...5 to 7 ft\nJamaica Beach to High Island...2 to 4 ft\nMouth of the Rio Grande to Port Mansfield...2 to 4 ft\nHigh Island to Morgan City...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe northeast of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding\ndepends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and\ncan vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to\nyour area, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are likely within the hurricane warning\narea late Friday and Friday night, with tropical storm conditions\nexpected to first reach the coast in the hurricane warning area\nFriday.  These conditions are likely to persist into Saturday in\nportions of the hurricane and tropical storm warning area.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are likely to affect the Texas,\nLouisiana, and northeast Mexico coasts by Friday.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\nTORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes are possible across portions of the\nmiddle and upper Texas coast on Friday.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisories at 1200 AM CDT and 200 AM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Beven\n\nNNNN",
