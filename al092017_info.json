Harvey is moving\ntoward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward the\nnorthwest is expected this evening, and Harvey's forward speed is\nforecast to slow down during the next couple of days.  On the\nforecast track, Harvey will approach the middle Texas coast on\nFriday and make landfall Friday night or early Saturday.  Harvey is\nthen likely to stall near or just inland of the middle Texas coast\nthrough the weekend.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Harvey is expected to become\na major hurricane by Friday before it reaches the middle Texas\ncoast.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the\ncenter, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles\n(150 km).\n\nThe minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data released by a\nNOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 976 mb (28.82 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 15 to 25 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 35 inches over\nthe middle and upper Texas coast through next Wednesday. During the\nsame time period Harvey is expected to produce total rain\naccumulations of 7 to 15 inches in far south Texas and the Texas\nHill Country over through central and southwest Louisiana, with\naccumulations of up to 7 inches extending into other parts of Texas\nand the lower Mississippi Valley. Rainfall from Harvey may cause\ndevastating and life-threatening flooding.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nN Entrance Padre Island Natl Seashore to Sargent...6 to 12 ft\nSargent to Jamaica Beach...5 to 8 ft\nPort Mansfield to N Entrance Padre Island Natl Seashore...5 to 7 ft\nJamaica Beach to High Island...2 to 4 ft\nMouth of the Rio Grande to Port Mansfield...2 to 4 ft\nHigh Island to Morgan City...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe northeast of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding\ndepends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and\ncan vary greatly over short distances.  For information specific to\nyour area, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are likely within the hurricane warning\narea late Friday or Friday night, with tropical storm conditions\nexpected to first reach the coast in the hurricane warning area\nFriday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are likely to affect the Texas,\nLouisiana, and northeast Mexico coasts by Friday.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
