Please see warnings and other products\nissued by your local National Weather Service office for additional\ninformation on this life-threatening situation.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, including possible\ninland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your\nlocal National Weather Service forecast office.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was\nlocated near latitude 29.0 North, longitude 97.0 West. Harvey is\ndrifting toward the southeast near 2 mph (4 km/h), and a slow\nsoutheastward motion is expected over the next couple of days.\nOn the forecast track, the center of Harvey is forecast to move off\nthe middle Texas coast on Monday and meander just offshore through\nMonday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.\nLittle change in strength is forecast during the next 24 hours.\nSome slight restrengthening is possible after the center moves\noff the coast on Monday night and Tuesday.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)\nprimarily over water to the east of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall\naccumulations of 15 to 25 inches through Friday over the upper Texas\ncoast and into southwestern Louisiana.  Isolated storm totals may\nreach 50 inches over the upper Texas coast, including the\nHouston/Galveston metropolitan area.  These rains are currently\nproducing catastrophic and life-threatening flooding, and flash\nflood emergencies are in effect for portions of southeastern Texas.\nDO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE AFFECTED AREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE\nPLACE.  DO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED ROADWAYS.  Please see warnings and\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service office for\nadditional information on this life-threatening situation.\n\nElsewhere, Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n5 to 15 inches farther south into the middle Texas coast, farther\nwest toward the Texas Hill Country, and farther east across south-\ncentral Louisiana.\n\nA list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather\nPrediction Center can be found at:\nwww.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nPort Aransas to Morgan City including Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the\narea of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large\nand destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the\nrelative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary\ngreatly over short distances.  For information specific to your\narea, please see products issued by your local National Weather\nService forecast office.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in an area near the\ncenter of Harvey and over portions of the tropical storm warning\narea along the coast.  Tropical storm conditions are likely to\npersist in areas of onshore flow within the warning area during the\nnext day or so.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the\nwatch area by Monday night.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the coasts of Texas\nand Louisiana.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening\nsurf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your\nlocal weather office.\n\nTORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through Monday near the\nupper Texas coast and into far southwest Louisiana.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
