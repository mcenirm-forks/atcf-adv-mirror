Katia is moving\ntoward the west-southwest near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this motion is\nexpected to continue through Saturday. The center of Katia will make\nlandfall in Mexico late tonight or early Saturday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Little change in strength is expected prior to landfall,\nfollowed by rapid weakening thereafter.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70\nmiles (110 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by\nas much as 5 to 8 feet above normal tide levels near and to the\nnorth of where Katia makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will\nbe accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nRAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n10 to 15 inches over northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, and\nPuebla.  Katia is also expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 2 to 5 inches over southern Tamaulipas, eastern San Luis Potosi,\nwestern Hidalgo, eastern Queretaro, and southern Veracruz through\nSaturday evening.  Isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches are\npossible in northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, Puebla, and San\nLuis Potosi. This rainfall will likely cause life-threatening flash\nfloods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the\nhurricane warning area tonight or early Saturday, with tropical\nstorm conditions expected to continue within the tropical storm\nwarning areas.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Katia will continue to affect portions of\nthe coast of southeastern Mexico during the next couple of days.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions. Please consult products from your local weather\noffice.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Roth/Lamers/Blake\n\nNNNN",
