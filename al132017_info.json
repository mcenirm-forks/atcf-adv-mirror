A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n\nHurricane warnings will likely be issued on Thursday morning for a\nportion of the watch area.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor\nproducts issued by your national meteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Katia was located\nnear latitude 21.7 North, longitude 94.8 West.  Katia is moving\ntoward the east-southeast near 2 mph (4 km/h).  Little overall\nmotion is anticipated through late Thursday, but then the hurricane\nis forecast to turn southwestward and be approaching the coast\nwithin the watch area late Friday or early Saturday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours and\nKatia could be near major hurricane strength at landfall.\n\nKatia is a small tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend\noutward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the center and tropical-storm-\nforce winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by\nas much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels along the\nimmediate coast within portions of the hurricane watch area.  Near\nthe coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive\nwaves.\n\nRAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n5 to 10 inches over northern Veracruz, and 2 to 5 inches over far\nsouthern Tamaulipas, northeast Puebla, and southern Veracruz through\nSaturday morning. Isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible\nin northern Veracruz.  This rainfall may cause life-threatening\nflash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous\nterrain.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by\nlate Friday, with tropical storm conditions possible early Friday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Katia are expected to affect portions of\nthe coast of southeastern Mexico on Thursday.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Blake\n\nNNNN",
