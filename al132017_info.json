A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor\nproducts issued by your national meteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Katia was located\nnear latitude 21.7 North, longitude 94.9 West. Katia is moving\ntoward the southeast near 3 mph (6 km/h). Little overall motion is\nanticipated through tonight, but a southwestward drift should begin\ntomorrow.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48\nhours.\n\nKatia is a small tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend\noutward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the center and tropical-storm-\nforce winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n5 to 10 inches over northern Veracruz, and 2 to 5 inches over far\nsouthern Tamaulipas, northeast Puebla, and southern Veracruz through\nSaturday morning. Isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible\nin northern Veracruz. This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash\nfloods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by\nlate Friday, with tropical storm conditions possible earlier that\nday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Katia are expected to affect\nportions of the coast of southeastern Mexico tomorrow.  These swells\nare likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Blake\n\nNNNN",
