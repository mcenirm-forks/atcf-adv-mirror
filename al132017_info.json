Katia is\nmoving toward the west-southwest near 2 mph (4 km/h) and it is\nexpected to continue drifting toward the west-southwest until\ndissipation.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher\ngusts. Katia is expected to dissipate over the mountains of\nMexico later today.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n10 to 15 inches over northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, and\nPuebla.  Katia is also expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 2 to 5 inches over southern Tamaulipas, eastern San Luis Potosi,\nwestern Hidalgo, eastern Queretaro, and southern Veracruz through\nSaturday evening.  Isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches are\npossible in northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, Puebla, and San\nLuis Potosi. This rainfall will likely cause life-threatening flash\nfloods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain.\n\nSTORM SURGE: Water levels along the coast should continue to\ndecrease as the center dissipates and winds subside.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Katia will begin to decrease along the\ncoast of southeastern Mexico today. These swells may still cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster R Ballard\n\nNNNN",
