Katia is\nmoving toward the west near 2 mph (4 km/h) and it is expected to\ndrift to the east of the Sierra Madre Mountains as it dissipates\ntoday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.\nWinds should continue to subside as Katia dissipates today.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)\nfrom the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  Some inundation along the coast due to storm surge\nwill remain possible this morning.  Water levels along the coast\nshould decrease as the storm moves inland and winds subside.\n\nRAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n10 to 15 inches over northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, and\nPuebla.  Katia is also expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 2 to 5 inches over southern Tamaulipas, eastern San Luis Potosi,\nwestern Hidalgo, eastern Queretaro, and southern Veracruz through\nSaturday evening.
