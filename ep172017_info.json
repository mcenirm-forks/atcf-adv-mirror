Norma is\nmoving toward the north near 3 mph (6 km/h). The tropical storm\nshould continue moving toward the north-northwest or northwest\nduring the next couple days at a slightly faster forward speed. On\nthe forecast track, the center of Norma will move near or to the\nwest of the southern Baja California Peninsula on Sunday and Monday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Some additional weakening is forecast during the\nnext 48 hours.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)\nfrom the center. The Mexican Navy station in Isla Socorro recently\nreported a sustained wind of 35 mph (56 km/hr) and a gust of 55 mph\n(89 km/h).\n\nThe minimum central pressure measured by the Air Force Hurricane\nHunter aircraft is 989 mb (29.21 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations\nof 2 to 4 inches over the southern portion of the Mexican state of\nBaja California Sur, with isolated maximum amounts up to 8 inches.\nThese rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash floods.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the\ncoast within the warning area by Sunday morning, making outside\npreparations difficult or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are\npossible within the watch area by late Sunday or early Monday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast\nof southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur and will continue\ninto early next week. These swells are likely to cause life-\nthreatening surf and rip current conditions.
