DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Eugene was located
near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 117.8 West.  Eugene is moving
toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this general motion
is expected to continue for the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours.  Eugene is expected to become a tropical storm later
tonight or Tuesday morning and a remnant low by Wednesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will spread northward to
portions of southern California by tonight and Tuesday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
