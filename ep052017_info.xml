DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 20.6 North, longitude 118.7 West.  Eugene is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue through Wednesday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours, and Eugene is expected to degenerate into a remnant low
on Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will spread northward to
portions of southern California today and Wednesday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
