MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM PDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Eugene
was located near latitude 24.1 North, longitude 122.5 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17
km/h) and this motion is expected to continue for the next two days
until dissipation.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast and the remnant low of Eugene is expected to
dissipate in two to three days.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene affecting portions of the west
coast of northern Baja California peninsula and southern California
will be diminishing on Thursday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnant
low please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and
