DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Eugene was located
near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 116.5 West.  Eugene is moving
toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue through Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours as Eugene moves over colder water.  Eugene is expected
to weaken to a tropical storm by tonight.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105
miles (165 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will spread northward to
portions of southern California by tonight and Tuesday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
