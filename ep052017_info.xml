WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 120.5 West. Eugene is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next 48
hours, and Eugene is expected to become a remnant low on Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will spread northward to
portions of southern California today and Wednesday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
