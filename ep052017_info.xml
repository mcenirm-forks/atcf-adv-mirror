DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 21.3 North, longitude 119.6 West. Eugene is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this motion is

Maximum sustained winds have dropped to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with
higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast during the next 48
hours, and Eugene is expected to become a remnant low on Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will spread northward to
portions of southern California today and Wednesday.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
