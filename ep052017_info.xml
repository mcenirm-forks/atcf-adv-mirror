SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 118.2 West.  Eugene is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours, and Eugene should degenerate into a remnant low by
Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will spread northward to
portions of southern California by tonight and Tuesday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.
