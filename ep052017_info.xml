DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM PDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Eugene was located
near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 117.2 West.  Eugene is moving
toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h) and this motion is
expected to continue during the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have dropped to near 85 mph (140 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast during the next 48
hours. Eugene is expected to become a tropical storm by Tuesday and
a remnant low by Wednesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and will spread northward to
portions of southern California by tonight and Tuesday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
