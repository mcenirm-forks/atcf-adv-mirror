...EUGENE EXPECTED TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW LATER TODAY...


SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...22.9N 121.1W
ABOUT 505 MI...810 KM SW OF PUNTA EUGENIA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1005 MB...29.68 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Eugene was
located near latitude 22.9 North, longitude 121.1 West.  Eugene is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through Thursday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the
next couple of days, and Eugene is expected to degenerate into a
remnant low later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Eugene are affecting portions of the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula and southern California.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 800 AM PDT.
