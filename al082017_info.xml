DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gert was located
near latitude 32.8 North, longitude 72.0 West.  Gert is moving
toward the north-northeast near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A gradual turn
toward the northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected
through the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  The hurricane is forecast to become a little stronger during
the next day or so.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will spread northward along the
east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward to
Long Island during the next couple of days.  Swells are also
expected to affect Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.

Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.
