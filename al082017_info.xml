SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.4N 65.7W
ABOUT 355 MI...575 KM N OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 510 MI...820 KM SSW OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gert was located
near latitude 37.4 North, longitude 65.7 West.  Gert is accelerating
toward the northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h).  An even faster motion
toward the northeast or east-northeast is expected through early
Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible later today or tonight, but
Gert is likely to begin weakening on Thursday.  Gert should become
an extratropical low by Thursday night.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will spread northward along the
east coast of the United States from Virginia northward to
New England and Atlantic Canada during the next day or two.
Swells are also expected to continue to affect Bermuda through
tonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.
