WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gert was located
near latitude 40.1 North, longitude 58.4 West.  Gert is moving
rapidly toward the east-northeast near 37 mph (59 km/h).  An even
faster motion toward the east-northeast is expected through
Thursday, followed by some deceleration and a turn toward the
northeast Thursday night and Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  A weakening trend is forecast to begin Thursday morning, and
Gert is likely to lose its tropical characteristics by Friday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 967 mb (28.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will affect the east coast of
the United States from Virginia northward to New England and
Atlantic Canada through Thursday.  Swells are also expected to
continue to affect Bermuda through tonight.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather forecast office.

Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.
