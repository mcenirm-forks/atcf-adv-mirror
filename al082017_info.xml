DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gert was located
near latitude 31.8 North, longitude 72.5 West. Gert is moving toward
the north near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward the northeast with
an increase in forward speed is expected later today.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gert has the opportunity to gather some strength later
today or Wednesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will spread northward along the
east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward to
Long Island during the next couple of days.  Swells are also
expected to affect Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
