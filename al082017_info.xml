DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Gert was
located near latitude 30.6 North, longitude 72.3 West. Gert is
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h).  This motion should
continue tonight.  A turn toward the northeast with an increase in
forward speed is expected late Tuesday or Tuesday night.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional strengthening is forecast and Gert
is expected to become a hurricane tonight.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will spread northward along the
east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward to
Long Island during the next couple of days.  Swells are also
expected to affect Bermuda during the next couple of days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
