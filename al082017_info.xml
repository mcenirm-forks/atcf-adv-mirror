...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...


SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...44.8N 46.0W
ABOUT 860 MI...1390 KM E OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
ABOUT 365 MI...590 KM ESE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 39 MPH...63 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Gert
was located near latitude 44.8 North, longitude 46.0 West.  The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near 39
mph (63 km/h).  Gert should move quickly toward the northeast for a
day or so, before slowing and merging with another low pressure
system over the weekend.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the
next 36 to 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will continue to affect the coast
of the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada through
tonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  Additional information on this system can be
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service,
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and available
