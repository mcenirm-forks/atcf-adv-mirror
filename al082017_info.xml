Hurricane Gert Advisory Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL082017
500 PM EDT Tue Aug 15 2017

...GERT A LITTLE STRONGER AND MOVING FASTER TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST...


SUMMARY OF 500 PM EDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.7N 71.2W
ABOUT 385 MI...615 KM WNW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 20 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...981 MB...28.97 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gert was located
near latitude 33.7 North, longitude 71.2 West.  Gert is moving
toward the north-northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h), and it is
expected to accelerate northeastward over the northwestern Atlantic
Ocean during the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is expected
during the next day or so.  Weakening should begin by Thursday when
Gert moves over colder water.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will spread northward along the
east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward to
Long Island during the next couple of days, with the first impacts
expected tonight.  Swells are also expected to affect Bermuda
during the next couple of days.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.
