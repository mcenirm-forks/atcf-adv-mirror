ABOUT 350 MI...560 KM S OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
ABOUT 525 MI...840 KM ESE OF HALIFAX NOVA SCOTIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gert was located
near latitude 41.7 North, longitude 54.0 West. Gert is moving
rapidly toward the east-northeast near 39 mph (63 km/h) and this
motion is expected to continue today.  A slower northeastward to
east-northeastward motion is expected on Friday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and Gert is
likely to lose its tropical characteristics by tonight.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles
(280 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will continue to affect the coast
of the northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada through
tonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.
