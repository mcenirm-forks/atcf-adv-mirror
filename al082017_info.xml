NORTHEASTWARD...


SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.0N 68.4W
ABOUT 330 MI...530 KM NW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 45 DEGREES AT 21 MPH...33 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...975 MB...28.80 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gert was located
near latitude 36.0 North, longitude 68.4 West. Gert is moving toward
the northeast near 21 mph (33 km/h).  An even faster
east-northeastward motion is expected during the next couple of
days.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible
today.  After that time, Gert is expected to weaken, and the
cyclone is forecast to become an extratropical low by Thursday
night.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 975 mb (28.80 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will spread northward along the
east coast of the United States from Virginia northward to
New England and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.
Swells are also expected to continue to affect Bermuda through
tonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.
