WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Gert was located
near latitude 38.7 North, longitude 62.4 West.  Gert is moving
quickly toward the northeast near 31 mph (50 km/h).  An even faster
motion toward the east-northeast is expected through Thursday,
followed by some deceleration and a turn toward the northeast
Thursday night and Friday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected through
tonight, but weakening is forecast to begin on Thursday.  Gert
should become an extratropical low by early Friday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Gert will spread northward along the
east coast of the United States from Virginia northward to
New England and Atlantic Canada during the next day or two.
Swells are also expected to continue to affect Bermuda through
tonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather forecast office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.
