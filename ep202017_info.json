Selma is\nmoving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and that general\nmotion is expected during the next 12 to 24 hours.  On the forecast\ntrack, the center of Selma is expected to make landfall along the\ncoast of El Salvador this morning.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Little change in strength is forecast before Selma reaches\nthe coast.  Rapid weakening is forecast after landfall, and Selma is\nexpected to dissipate over the mountains of Central America by\nearly Sunday.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)\nfrom the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n3 to 6 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala, southern\nHonduras and far western Nicaragua through Sunday.  Isolated maximum\namounts of 10 inches are possible in El Salvador and southern\nGuatemala.  This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods\nand mudslides.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the\ncoast within the warning area overnight, making outside preparations\ndifficult or dangerous.  Tropical storm conditions are possible\nwithin the watch area by early Saturday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Selma are affecting portions of the\ncoasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions.
