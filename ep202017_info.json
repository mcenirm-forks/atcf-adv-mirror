Selma is\nmoving toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this\ngeneral motion is expected during the next day.  On the forecast\ntrack Selma should make landfall in El Salvador during the next few\nhours and dissipate over Central America by tonight.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.\nLittle change in strength is anticipated before landfall, with\nrapid weakening expected thereafter.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km),\nprimarily to the east of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n2 to 5 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala and southern\nHonduras through Sunday.

Tropical storm conditions, primarily in gusts, are\npossible within the watch area by Saturday morning.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Selma are affecting portions of the\ncoasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions.
