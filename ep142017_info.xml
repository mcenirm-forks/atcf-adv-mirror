BULLETIN
Tropical Depression Lidia Advisory Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142017
800 PM PDT Sat Sep 02 2017

...LIDIA WEAKENING BUT STILL PRODUCING RAIN OVER PARTS OF MEXICO...


SUMMARY OF 800 PM PDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...29.0N 115.8W
ABOUT 95 MI...150 KM NNW OF PUNTA EUGENIA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1002 MB...29.59 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the east coast of the Baja California peninsula from
Bahia San Juan Bautista to Isla San Luis.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM PDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Lidia
was located near latitude 29.0 North, longitude 115.8 West. The
depression is moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and
this general motion is expected to continue for the next day or two.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Lidia is expected to become a remnant low
by early Sunday morning.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and the coastal section of Sonora and northern
Sinaloa, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. These rains may
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Some of the
tropical moisture from Lidia will spread across parts of the desert
Southwest this holiday weekend for an increase in scattered showers
and thunderstorms, from southern Nevada and western Arizona into
southern California.

WIND:  All Tropical Storm Warnings have been discontinued.  Wind
speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains may be
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of western mainland Mexico and the west coast of Baja California
Sur.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 AM PDT.
