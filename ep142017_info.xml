WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of Mexico has extended the Tropical Storm Warning on
the west coast of the Baja California peninsula northward to San
Jose de Las Palomas, on the east coast northward to Isla San
Luis, and along the coast of mainland Mexico northward to Puerto
Libertad.

The government of Mexico has discontinued the Hurricane Watch for
Baja California Sur, as well as the Tropical Storm Warning south of
Altata on the coast of mainland Mexico.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Baja California peninsula from San Jose de Las Palomas to Isla
San Luis
* Mainland Mexico from Altata to Puerto Libertad

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

Interests elsewhere in western Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Lidia.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 111.0 West.  Lidia is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this
direction with an increase in forward speed is expected through
Saturday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Lidia will
move near or along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula
through Saturday and then move west of the peninsula over the
Pacific waters Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days while
Lidia interacts with the mountainous terrain of the Baja California
peninsula.  Lidia is expected to become a remnant low by Saturday
night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km),
especially to the northeast and southeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California, Sinaloa, and the coastal section of Sonora, with
isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches.  These rains may cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.  Some of the tropical
moisture from Lidia may reach parts of the Desert Southwest this
holiday weekend, including southern California, southern Nevada, and
southwestern Arizona.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over the southern
portion of Baja California Sur at this time.  These conditions
should spread northward across the warning areas of the Baja
California peninsula and mainland Mexico through Saturday.  Wind
speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are
often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja
California Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
