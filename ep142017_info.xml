PORTIONS OF MAINLAND MEXICO...


SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula
from Todos Santos to Los Barriles.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The west coast of the Baja California peninsula from San Jose de
Las Palomas to Todos Santos
* The east coast of the Baja California peninsula from Isla San
Luis to Los Barriles
* Mainland Mexico from Altata to Puerto Libertad

Interests elsewhere in northwestern Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Lidia.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products
issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 111.9 West. Lidia is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next 48 hours.  On the
forecast track, the center of Lidia will move near or along the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula through Saturday and then
move west of the peninsula over the Pacific Ocean late Saturday or
Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast during the next couple of days while Lidia
interacts with the mountainous terrain of the Baja California
peninsula and moves over cold Pacific water.  Lidia is expected to
become a remnant low by Saturday night or Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
mainly to the east of the center.  A Mexican automated station near
Loreto recently reported sustained winds of 53 mph (85 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California, Sinaloa and the coastal section of Sonora, with
isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches.  These rains may cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.  Some of the tropical
moisture from Lidia may reach parts of the desert Southwest this
holiday weekend, including southern California, southern Nevada and
southwestern Arizona.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area
over the southern and central portions of Baja California Sur and
over portions of the Mexican mainland at this time.  These
conditions should spread northward across the warning areas of the
Baja California peninsula and mainland Mexico through Saturday.
Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains
are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja
California Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
