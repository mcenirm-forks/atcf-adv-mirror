Tropical Storm Lidia Advisory Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142017
900 AM MDT Sat Sep 02 2017

...LIDIA WEAKENING AS IT MOVES THROUGH NORTHERN BAJA CALIFORNIA
SUR...


SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...27.9N 114.3W
ABOUT 50 MI...80 KM E OF PUNTA EUGENIA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the west coast of the Baja California peninsula south
of Punta Abreojos, and for the east coast of the Baja California
peninsula south of Mulege.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The west coast of the Baja California peninsula from Punta
Abreojos to San Jose de Las Palomas
* The east coast of the Baja California peninsula from Mulege to
Isla San Luis
* Mainland Mexico from Guaymas to Puerto Libertad

Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California and
Sonora should monitor the progress of Lidia.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 27.9 North, longitude 114.3 West.  Lidia is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion
is expected to continue through Sunday night.  A turn toward the
west-northwest is expected on Monday.  On the forecast track,
Lidia's center will emerge over the Pacific during the next few
hours and then move away from the Baja California peninsula later
today and tonight.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with
higher gusts, mainly over the Gulf of California to the east of the
center.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Lidia is expected to
become a tropical depression later today and a remnant low pressure
area tonight or Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
to the east of the center.  A Mexican automated station at Bahia de
Los Angeles recently reported a wind gust of 48 mph (77 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and the coastal section of Sonora and northern
Sinaloa, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. These rains may
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Some of the
tropical moisture from Lidia will spread across parts of the desert
Southwest through this holiday weekend for an increase in scattered
showers and thunderstorms, from southern Nevada and western Arizona
into southern California.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
warning area in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur, Baja
California, and Sonora, especially near the coast of the Gulf of
California.  These conditions should persist for the next several
hours.  Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and
mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface
winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations
could be even greater.

STORM SURGE:  Some coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds along the Baja California peninsula.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of western mainland Mexico and the west coast of Baja California
Sur.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
