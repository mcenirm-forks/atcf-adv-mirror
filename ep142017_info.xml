CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Baja California peninsula from San Jose de Las Palomas to Isla
San Luis
* Mainland Mexico from Altata to Puerto Libertad

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

Interests elsewhere in northwestern Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Lidia.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located over the Mexican state of Baja California Sur near latitude
24.6 North, longitude 111.2 West. Lidia is moving toward the
northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this motion is expected to
continue with an increase in forward speed during the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, the center of Lidia will move near or
along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula through
Saturday and then move west of the peninsula over the Pacific Ocean
Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days while Lidia interacts with the mountainous terrain of
the Baja California peninsula and moves over cold Pacific water.
Lidia is expected to become a remnant low by Saturday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
mainly to the east of the center.  Los Mochis on the Mexican
mainland recently reported sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California, Sinaloa and the coastal section of Sonora, with
isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches.  These rains may cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.  Some of the tropical
moisture from Lidia may reach parts of the desert Southwest this
holiday weekend, including southern California, southern Nevada and
southwestern Arizona.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over the southern
portion of Baja California Sur and over portions of the Mexican
mainland at this time.  These conditions should spread northward
across the warning areas of the Baja California peninsula and
mainland Mexico through Saturday.  Wind speeds atop and on the
windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and
in some elevated locations could be even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja
California Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
