DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
estimated by NASA Global Hawk dropsonde data and satellite images
near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 108.9 West.  Lidia is moving
toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue for the next couple of days.  On the forecast
track, the center of Lidia will be near the southern tip of the Baja
California peninsula by late today and will move across the
peninsula on Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours, and
Lidia still has the opportunity to be near hurricane strength near
the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
to the east of the center.

The minimum central pressure based on the NASA Global Hawk data is
998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
8 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur and
western Jalisco, with isolated maximum totals of 20 inches.  In the
Mexican states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Colima, southern Michoacan,
southern Sonora and central Jalisco, rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches are expected. These rains are expected to cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area later this morning, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the hurricane watch area late today.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the warning area in mainland Mexico
starting late today, and in the watch areas in Baja California Sur
on Friday.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds on the
southern portion of Baja California Sur.  Near the coast, the surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico.  These swells are beginning to
reach the southern portions of Baja California Sur, and could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
