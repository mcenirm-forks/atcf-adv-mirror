Interests elsewhere in western Mexico and Baja California Sur should
monitor the progress of this system.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
The large area of disturbed weather south of the Baja California
Peninsula has consolidated and is now Tropical Storm Lidia. At 600
PM MDT (0000 UTC), Lidia was centered near latitude 20.4 North,
longitude 109.0 West. The system is moving toward the north-
northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion is expected
to continue for the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the
center of Lidia will be near the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula by late Thursday, and near Baja California Sur on Friday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and
Lidia still has the opportunity to become a hurricane before
landfall.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
8 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur and
western Jalisco, with isolated maximum totals of 20 inches.  In the
Mexican states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Colima, southern Michoacan,
southern Sonora and central Jalisco, rainfall amounts of 3 to 6
inches are expected. These rains are expected to cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. There are already
reports of road closures due to mud-slides in southwestern Mexico.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by early Thursday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the hurricane watch area late Thursday.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible in the warning area in mainland Mexico
starting late on Thursday, and in the watch areas in Baja California
Sur on Friday.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and east of the center over
the southern portion of Baja California Sur. Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico.  These swells will reach the
southern portions of Baja California Sur tonight, and could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
