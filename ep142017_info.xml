SUR...

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm Warning
south of Puerto San Andresito, south of Loreto, and south of
Guaymas.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The west coast of the Baja California peninsula from Puerto San
Andresito to San Jose de Las Palomas
* The east coast of the Baja California peninsula from Loreto to
Isla San Luis
* Mainland Mexico from Guaymas to Puerto Libertad

Interests elsewhere in the Mexican states of Baja California and
Sonora should monitor the progress of Lidia.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located over Baja California Sur near latitude 27.2 North, longitude
113.6 West.  Lidia is moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19
km/h), and this motion is expected to continue through Sunday.  A
turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by Sunday night.  On the
forecast track, Lidia's center will move near or along the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula through tonight and then
gradually move away from land on Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Lidia is expected to become a tropical
depression tonight and then a remnant low on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
mainly to the northeast and southeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and the coastal section of Sonora and northern
Sinaloa, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. These rains may
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Some of the
tropical moisture from Lidia will spread across parts of the desert
Southwest this holiday weekend for an increase in scattered showers
and thunderstorms, from southern Nevada and western Arizona into
southern California.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
warning area in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur, Baja
California, and Sonora.  These conditions should spread northward
across the remainder of the warning areas through the day.  Wind
speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are
often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.

STORM SURGE:  Some coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds along the Baja California peninsula.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of western mainland Mexico and the west coast of Baja California
Sur.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
