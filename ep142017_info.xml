DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 22.5 North, longitude 110.0 West. Lidia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue through Friday, with a turn
toward the northwest expected Friday night.  On the forecast track,
the center of Lidia will pass near or over the southern tip of
the Baja California peninsula during the next few hours, and then
will move over the peninsula through Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (105 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible during
the next few hours.  Weakening is expected tonight through Friday
night as the center moves over the Baja California peninsula.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.  The Cabo San Lucas International Airport recently
reported sustained winds of 58 mph (93 km/h), while a Mexican
automated station near Cabo San Lucas recently reported sustained
winds of 70 mph (113 km/h) and a wind gust of 90 mph (145 km/h) at
an elevation of 735 ft (244 m).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.26 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
8 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and western Jalisco, with isolated maximum totals of
20 inches. In the Mexican states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Colima,
southern Michoacan, southern Sonora and central Jalisco, rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches are expected. These rains are expected to
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are spreading over the southern
portion of Baja California Sur at this time.  These conditions
should spread northward across the warning area today through
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane
watch area during the next several hours.  Tropical storm conditions
are expected in the warning area in mainland Mexico starting later
today or tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the
watch areas late Friday or Friday night.  Wind speeds atop and on
the windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and
in some elevated locations could be even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja
California Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
