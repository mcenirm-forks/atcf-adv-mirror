...LIDIA CONTINUES TO PRODUCE HEAVY RAINS OVER MEXICO...


SUMMARY OF 500 PM PDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...28.9N 115.1W
ABOUT 75 MI...120 KM N OF PUNTA EUGENIA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 10 MPH...17 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The east coast of the Baja California peninsula from Bahia San
Juan Bautista to Isla San Luis

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products
issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM PDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 28.9 North, longitude 115.1 West. Lidia is
moving toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn toward
the west-northwest is expected tonight or tomorrow, and Lidia should
continue on that heading until dissipation in a couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.  Lidia
is expected to weaken to a tropical depression tonight and become a
remnant low on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and the coastal section of Sonora and northern
Sinaloa, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. These rains may
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Some of the
tropical moisture from Lidia will spread across parts of the desert
Southwest through this holiday weekend for an increase in scattered
showers and thunderstorms, from southern Nevada and western Arizona
into southern California.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
warning area in the Mexican state of Baja California, along the
coast of the Gulf of California.  Winds in these locations are
expected to decrease below tropical-storm-force during the next
couple of hours.  Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of
hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the
near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated
locations could be even greater.

STORM SURGE:  Some coastal flooding is possible in areas of onshore
winds along the Baja California peninsula.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of western mainland Mexico and the west coast of Baja California
Sur.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM PDT.
