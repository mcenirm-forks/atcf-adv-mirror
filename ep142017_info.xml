DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 109.7 West. Lidia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue through Friday, with a turn
toward the northwest expected Friday night.  On the forecast track,
the center of Lidia will be near the southern tip of the Baja
California peninsula during the next several hours, and will move
over the peninsula through Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible today.
Weakening is expected tonight through Friday night as the center
moves over the Baja California peninsula.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.  A Mexican automated station near Cabo San Lucas
recently reported a sustained wind of 59 mph (95 km/h) and a wind
gust of 78 mph (126 km/h) at an elevation of 735 ft (224 m).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
8 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and western Jalisco, with isolated maximum totals of
20 inches. In the Mexican states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Colima,
southern Michoacan, southern Sonora and central Jalisco, rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches are expected. These rains are expected to
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are spreading over the southern
portion of Baja California Sur at this time.  These conditions
should spread northward across the warning area today through
Friday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane
watch area late today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in
the warning area in mainland Mexico starting later today or
tonight. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch areas
late Friday or Friday night.  Wind speeds atop and on the windward
sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger
than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some
elevated locations could be even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja
California Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
