DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 600 PM MDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 22.7 North, longitude 110.2 West. Lidia has
moved very little during the past couple of hours, but is expected
to resume a north-northwest track near 8 mph (13 km/h) tonight and
continue through Friday. A turn toward the northwest is expected
Friday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Lidia will move
near or over the Baja California peninsula through Friday night.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  No significant change in strength is expected this evening.
Thereafter, weakening is forecast as the circulation interacts
with the high terrain of the Baja California peninsula.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
mainly to the east of the center.  Surface observations indicate
that tropical-storm conditions are occurring over the southern end
of the Baja California peninsula. Cabo San Lucas Marina recently
reported a sustained wind of 44 mph (71 km/h) and a gust of 66 mph
(106 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.27 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
8 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and western Jalisco, with isolated maximum totals of
20 inches. In the Mexican states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Colima,
southern Michoacan, southern Sonora and central Jalisco, rainfall
amounts of 3 to 6 inches are expected.  These rains are expected to
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over the southern
portion of Baja California Sur at this time.  These conditions
should spread northward across the warning area tonight through
Friday night.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the
hurricane watch area during the next several hours.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the warning area in mainland Mexico
through Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch
areas Friday night or Saturday.  Wind speeds atop and on the
windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and
in some elevated locations could be even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja
California Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
