For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 23.6 North, longitude 110.7 West. Lidia is
moving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue through today. On the forecast track,
the center of Lidia will move near or over the Baja California
peninsula through Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  A gradual weakening is forecast, but Lidia is anticipated to
remain a tropical storm during the next day or so.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
mainly to the northeast and southeast of the center.  A sustained
wind of 54 mph (87 km/h) and a wind gust to 68 mph (109 km/h) were
recently reported at Cabo Pulmo, Baja California Sur.  A wind gust
to 45 mph (72 km/h) was recently measured at Topolobampo, Sinaloa,
on the eastern side of the Gulf of California.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface
observations from southern Baja California Sur is 987 mb (29.15
inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California, Sinaloa and the coastal section of Sonora, with
isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches. These rains may cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Some of the tropical
moisture from Lidia may reach parts of the desert Southwest this
holiday weekend, including southern California, southern Nevada and
southwestern Arizona.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over the southern
portion of Baja California Sur at this time.  These conditions
should spread northward across the warning area through Friday
night. Hurricane conditions are still possible within the hurricane
watch area during the next few hours.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the warning area in mainland Mexico through Friday.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch areas Friday
night or Saturday.  Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of
hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the
near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated
locations could be even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja
California Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by
large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
