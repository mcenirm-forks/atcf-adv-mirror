...LIDIA FORECAST TO WEAKEN BUT EXPECTED TO DUMP ADDITIONAL RAIN...


SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Government of Mexico has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for the west coast of the Baja California peninsula
south of Puerto Cortes, and for the east coast of the peninsula
south of San Evaristo. The Tropical Storm Warning for mainland
Mexico south of Huatabampito has also been discontinued.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The west coast of the Baja California peninsula from San Jose de
Las Palomas to Puerto Cortes
* The east coast of the Baja California peninsula from Isla San
Luis to San Evaristo
* Mainland Mexico from Huatabampito to Puerto Libertad

Interests elsewhere in northwestern Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Lidia.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 26.4 North, longitude 112.9 West. Lidia is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next 48 hours.  On the
forecast track, the center of Lidia will move near or along the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula for the next day or two.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Lidia is expected to become a remnant low
Saturday night or on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
mainly to the east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and the coastal section of Sonora and northern
Sinaloa, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. These rains may
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Some of the
tropical moisture from Lidia will spread across parts of the desert
Southwest this holiday weekend for an increase in scattered showers
and thunderstorms, from southern Nevada and western Arizona into
southern California.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in the warning area
over portions of Baja California Sur and over portions of the
Mexican mainland at this time.  These conditions should spread
northward across the warning areas of the Baja California peninsula
and mainland Mexico through Saturday. Wind speeds atop and on the
windward sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent
stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and
in some elevated locations could be even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
in areas of onshore winds in Baja California Sur.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
