SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* The west coast of the Baja California peninsula from San Jose de
Las Palomas to Puerto Cortes
* The east coast of the Baja California peninsula from Isla San
Luis to San Evaristo
* Mainland Mexico from Huatabampito to Puerto Libertad

Interests elsewhere in northwestern Mexico and the Baja California
peninsula should monitor the progress of Lidia.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Lidia was
located near latitude 26.8 North, longitude 113.3 West.  Lidia is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next 48 hours.  On the
forecast track, the center of Lidia will move near or along the west
coast of the Baja California peninsula for the next day or two.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Lidia is expected to become a
remnant low Saturday night or on Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
mainly to the east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
4 to 8 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into
Baja California and the coastal section of Sonora and northern
Sinaloa, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. These rains may
cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Some of the
tropical moisture from Lidia will spread across parts of the desert
Southwest this holiday weekend for an increase in scattered showers
and thunderstorms, from southern Nevada and western Arizona into
southern California.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over portions of the
warning area in the Mexican states of Baja California Sur, Baja
California, and Sonora.  These conditions should spread northward
across the remainder of the warning areas through Saturday.  Wind
speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains are
often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds
indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be
even greater.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
in areas of onshore winds along the Baja California peninsula.  Near
the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja
California Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.


NEXT ADVISORY
