NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142017
200 AM PDT Sun Sep 03 2017

...LIDIA DEGENERATES INTO A REMNANT LOW...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...


SUMMARY OF 200 AM PDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...29.6N 116.3W
ABOUT 40 MI...65 KM SW OF PUNTA BAJA MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1003 MB...29.62 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM PDT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Lidia
was located near latitude 29.6 North, longitude 116.3 West.  Lidia
is moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this motion
at a slightly faster forward speed is expected through today.  A
turn toward the west-northwest is forecast by tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is forecast, and Lidia is expected to dissipate by Monday
night.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  The heavy rainfall threat associated with Lidia continues
to diminish as the storm weakens.  Additional rainfall totals of 1
to 2 inches are possible over the northern Baja California peninsula
through today.  The tropical moisture from Lidia will spread across
parts of the desert Southwest this holiday weekend with an increase
in scattered showers and thunderstorms from southern Nevada, western
Arizona and into southern California.

SURF:  Residual swells generated by Lidia will gradually diminish
along the west coast of the Baja California peninsula during the
next day or two but could still cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  For additional information on the remnant
low please see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather
Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and
