DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 93.4 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next 24 to 36 hours.  On the
forecast track, the center of Franklin is expected to approach the
coast of eastern Mexico today, then cross the coast in the Mexican
state of Veracruz tonight or early Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected, and
Franklin is forecast to become a hurricane later today and reach the
coast of Mexico as a hurricane tonight or early Thursday.  Rapid
weakening is expected after landfall in Mexico.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.  The Mexican automated station at Cayo Arcas,
located to the east of the center, recently reported sustained winds
of 48 mph (76 km/h) and a wind gust of 63 mph (101 km/h).

The minimum central pressure measured by Air Force and NOAA
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches across portions of the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico through Monday.  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible
across the Mexican states of Tabasco, northern Veracruz, northern
Puebla, Tlaxacala, Hidalgo, Queretar and eastern San Louis Potosi in
eastern Mexico.  These rains will be capable of producing
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the Hurricane Warning area by tonight.  Winds are expected to first
reach tropical storm strength later today, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.

Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
Tropical Storm Warning area along the southern shore of the
Bay of Campeche through tonight.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the Hurricane Watch area tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm Warning area in
eastern Mexico by this evening.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the
immediate coast near and to the north of where the center makes
landfall in the Hurricane Warning area.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
