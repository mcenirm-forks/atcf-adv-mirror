products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 98.3 West.  Franklin is
moving a little south of west near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this motion
is expected to continue today.  On the forecast track, the center of
Franklin should continue to move over Mexico today.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected as Franklin
moves over Mexico, and the cyclone is likely to dissipate later
today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
mainly to the northeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Franklin is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15
inches possible across the Mexican states of northern Veracruz,
Puebla, Tlaxacala, eastern Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Queretaro and
eastern San Luis Potosi in eastern Mexico.  These rains are capable
of producing life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions may still be occurring in
portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area in eastern Mexico
during the next few hours.  These conditions will subside later
this morning.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.
