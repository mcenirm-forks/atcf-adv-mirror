DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 18.0 North, longitude 85.4 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue over the next 48 hours.  On
the forecast track, the center of Franklin will be near the east
coast of the Yucatan peninsula by this evening.  Franklin is then
expected to move across the Yucatan Peninsula tonight and on
Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast until the center reaches the east
coast of the Yucatan peninsula, and Franklin could be near hurricane
strength by the time landfall occurs this evening or tonight.  Some
weakening is likely while the system moves across the Yucatan
Peninsula on Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.

The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 999 mb (29.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated amounts
of around 12 inches, are possible across the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico and Belize through Wednesday, with the highest amounts over
the Mexican state of Quintana Roo.  These rains could produce
life-threatening flash floods.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible in the Hurricane Watch
area by this evening.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to
begin in portions of the warning area this afternoon or evening.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area in Mexico
on Tuesday.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast near and to the north of where the center makes landfall.
Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.
