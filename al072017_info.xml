DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located over the Bay of Campeche near latitude 20.3 North, longitude
90.9 West.  Franklin is moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph
(19 km/h).  A mainly westward motion is expected over the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Franklin will
move westward across the Bay of Campeche tonight and Wednesday, and
be near the coast of mainland Mexico within the state of Veracruz
Wednesday night or early Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  A strengthening trend is likely to begin now that the center
is over water, and Franklin could be near hurricane intensity at
landfall.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface reports
from Campeche, Mexico, is 999 mb (29.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches, and isolated maximum amounts of 12
inches are possible across portions of the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico through Wednesday.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with
isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches are possible across northern
portions of Belize and northern portions of Guatemala.  Rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches
are possible across the Mexican states of Tabasco, northern
Veracruz, northern Puebla, Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Queretaro, and eastern
San Louis Potosi in eastern Mexico.  These rains may produce
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions may be occurring over portions of
the northwestern Yucatan Peninsula.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the Hurricane Watch area by Wednesday evening.
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm
Warning area in mainland Mexico by Wednesday evening.  Tropical
storm conditions are possible within the Tropical Storm Watch area
through Wednesday morning.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the
immediate coast near and to the north of where the center
makes landfall in the Hurricane Watch area.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
