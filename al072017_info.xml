DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 83.0 West. Franklin is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue over the next 48 hours.  On
the forecast track, the center will pass north of Honduras tonight
and early Monday, then approach the east coast of the Yucatan
peninsula on Monday afternoon.  The system is forecast to move
across the Yucatan Peninsula Monday night and Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast before Franklin reaches the eastern coast
of the Yucatan peninsula.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center, mainly to the northeast.  NOAA buoy 42057 in the
northwest Caribbean Sea has recently reported peak sustained winds
of 40 mph with a gust to 49 mph.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated amounts
of around 12 inches, are possible across the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico and Belize through Wednesday.  These rains could produce
life-threatening flash floods.

WIND: Tropical Storm conditions are expected to begin in portions
of the warning area by Monday afternoon.  Tropical Storm conditions
are possible in portions of the watch area in Belize by Monday
afternoon.  Tropical Storm conditions are possible in the watch
area in Mexico on Tuesday.
