DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 95.4 West.  Franklin
is moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.  On the
forecast track, the center of Franklin is expected to cross the
coast of the Mexican state of Veracruz later tonight or early
Thursday.

An Air Force plane is approaching the hurricane and preliminary
reports indicate that the maximum sustained winds have increased
to near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher gusts. Some additional
strengthening is expected until the center crosses the coast.  Rapid
weakening is expected after landfall in Mexico.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure just reported by an Air Force
plane was 983 mb (29.03 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum
amounts of 15 inches are possible across the Mexican states of
Tabasco, northern Veracruz, northern Puebla, Tlaxacala, Hidalgo,
Queretar and eastern San Luis Potosi in eastern Mexico.  These rains
will be capable of producing life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the Hurricane Warning area tonight.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.

Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
Tropical Storm Warning area along the southern shore of the Bay of
Campeche through tonight.  Hurricane conditions are possible within
the Hurricane Watch area tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the Tropical Storm Warning area in eastern Mexico by
this evening.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide levels along the
immediate coast near and to the north of where the center makes
landfall in the Hurricane Warning area.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
