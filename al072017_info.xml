DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 94.4 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.  On the
forecast track, the center of Franklin is expected to approach the
coast of eastern Mexico today, then cross the coast in the Mexican
state of Veracruz tonight or early Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is expected, and Franklin is forecast to
become a hurricane later today and reach the coast of Mexico as a
hurricane tonight or early Thursday.  Rapid weakening is expected
after landfall in Mexico.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter
aircraft observations is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches across portions of Belize and the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico through today.  Rainfall totals of 4 to
8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible
across the Mexican states of Tabasco, northern Veracruz, northern
Puebla, Tlaxacala, Hidalgo, Queretar and eastern San Luis Potosi in
eastern Mexico.  These rains will be capable of producing
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the Hurricane Warning area by tonight.  Winds are expected to first
reach tropical storm strength later today, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.

Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
Tropical Storm Warning area along the southern shore of the
Bay of Campeche through tonight.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the Hurricane Watch area tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm Warning area in
eastern Mexico by this evening.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide levels along the
immediate coast near and to the north of where the center makes
landfall in the Hurricane Warning area.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
