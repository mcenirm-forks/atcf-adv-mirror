For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 19.9 North, longitude 97.6 West. Franklin is
moving a little south of west near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this motion
is expected to continue today.  On the forecast track, the center
of Franklin should continue to move across eastern Mexico today.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional rapid weakening is expected as
Franklin moves across eastern Mexico, and the cyclone is likely to
dissipate late Thursday or early Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
mainly to the northeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Franklin is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum of 15 inches
possible across the Mexican states of northern Veracruz, Puebla,
Tlaxacala, eastern Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Queretaro and eastern San
Luis Potosi in eastern Mexico.  These rains are capable of producing
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected across the Tropical
Storm Warning area in eastern Mexico during the next several hours.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge along the coast in the
Tropical Storm Warning area should subside today.  Near the coast,
the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
