DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Franklin was
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 96.7 West. Franklin is
moving a little south of west near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue during the next day or so.
During the past hour, the center of Franklin made landfall in the
Mexican state of Veracruz near the town of Lechuguillas.  The center
is expected to move farther inland during the next several hours.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that the maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is forecast as the hurricane moves
farther inland.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).

The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 988 mb (29.18 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum
amounts of 15 inches are possible across the Mexican states of
Tabasco, northern Veracruz, northern Puebla, Tlaxacala, Hidalgo,
Queretar and eastern San Luis Potosi in eastern Mexico.  These rains
will be capable of producing life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are occurring on the coast within
the Hurricane Warning area. Preparations to protect life and
property should be rushed to completion.

Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
Tropical Storm Warning area along the southern shore of the Bay of
Campeche through early Thursday.  Hurricane conditions are possible
within the Hurricane Watch area for the next few hours.
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm
Warning area in eastern Mexico during the next several hours.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide levels along the
immediate coast near and to the north of where the center makes
landfall in the Hurricane Warning area.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
