DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 83.7 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue over the next 48 hours.  On
the forecast track, the center will pass north of Honduras today,
then approach the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula this afternoon
and early evening.  Franklin is then forecast to move across the
Yucatan Peninsula tonight and on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Strengthening is forecast before Franklin reaches the
eastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center, mainly to the northeast.  NOAA buoy 42057 in the
northwestern Caribbean Sea recently measured a peak sustained wind
of 45 mph (75 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated amounts
of around 12 inches, are possible across the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico and Belize through Wednesday.  These rains could produce
life-threatening flash floods.

WIND: Tropical Storm conditions are expected to begin in portions
of the warning area this afternoon.  Tropical Storm conditions
are possible in portions of the watch area in Belize by late
afternoon.  Tropical Storm conditions are possible in the watch
area in Mexico on Tuesday.
