DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 91.3 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn
toward the west is expected overnight, with Franklin maintaining
that motion up until landfall.  On the forecast track, the center
of Franklin will move westward over the Bay of Campeche overnight
and on Wednesday and is forecast to cross the coast of the Mexican
state of Veracruz Wednesday night or early Thursday.

Reports from Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50
mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is
expected, and Franklin is forecast to become a hurricane late
Wednesday and reach the coast of Mexico as a hurricane Wednesday
night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)
from the center.

The latest minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Reserve
reconnaissance aircraft is 996 mb (29.42 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches, and isolated maximum amounts of 12
inches are possible across portions of the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico through tonight.  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with
isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible across the
Mexican states of Tabasco, northern Veracruz, northern Puebla,
Tlaxcala, Hidalgo, Queretaro, and eastern San Louis Potosi in
eastern Mexico.  These rains may produce life-threatening flash
floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within
the Hurricane Warning area by Wednesday night.  Winds are expected
to first reach tropical storm strength on Wednesday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.

Tropical storm conditions are expected across portions of the
Tropical Storm Warning area along the southern shore of the
Bay of Campeche through Wednesday night. Hurricane conditions are
possible within the Hurricane Watch area Wednesday night.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm Warning area
in mainland Mexico by Wednesday evening.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the
immediate coast near and to the north of where the center
makes landfall in the Hurricane Watch area.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
