DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Franklin was
located near latitude 20.0 North, longitude 89.9 West.  Franklin is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A
west-northwestward to westward motion is expected over the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Franklin will
move into the Bay of Campeche later today, move westward across the
Bay of Campeche tonight and Wednesday, and be near the coast of
mainland Mexico Wednesday night or early Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some additional weakening may occur until the center moves
back over water, and strengthening is expected thereafter until
landfall occurs in mainland Mexico.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches and isolated maximum amounts of 12
inches are possible across portions of the Yucatan Peninsula of
Mexico through Wednesday.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with
isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches are possible across northern
portions of Belize and northern portions of Guatemala.  Rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches
are possible across the Mexican states of Tabasco, northern
Veracruz, northern Puebla, Tlaxacala, Hidalgo, Queretar and eastern
San Louis Potosi in eastern Mexico.  These rains may produce
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely still occurring over
portions of the northern and western Yucatan peninsula.
Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area
by Wednesday evening.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
within the Tropical Storm Warning area in mainland Mexico by
Wednesday evening.  Tropical storm conditions are possible
within the tropical storm watch area today and tonight.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the
immediate coast near and to the north of where the center
makes landfall in the Hurricane Watch area.  Near the coast, the
surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
