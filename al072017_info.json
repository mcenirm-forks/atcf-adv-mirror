Franklin is\nmoving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this general motion\nis expected to continue for the next 24 to 36 hours.

Additional strengthening is expected, and\nFranklin is forecast to become a hurricane later today and reach the\ncoast of Mexico as a hurricane tonight or early Thursday.  Rapid\nweakening is expected after landfall in Mexico.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)\nfrom the center.  The Mexican automated station at Cayo Arenas,\nlocated to the north-northeast of the center, recently reported\nsustained winds of 39 mph (63 km/h) and a wind gust of 51 mph\n(81 km/h).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce additional rainfall\naccumulations of 1 to 3 inches across portions of the Yucatan\nPeninsula of Mexico through Monday.
