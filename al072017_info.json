Franklin is\nmoving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A\nwest-northwestward to westward motion is expected over the next\ncouple of days.

Tropical storm conditions are expected\nwithin the Tropical Storm Warning area in mainland Mexico by\nWednesday evening.

Near the coast, the\nsurge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
