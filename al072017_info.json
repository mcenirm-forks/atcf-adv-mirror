Additional strengthening is expected, and\nFranklin is forecast to become a hurricane later today and reach the\ncoast of Mexico as a hurricane tonight or early Thursday.  Rapid\nweakening is expected after landfall in Mexico.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)\nfrom the center.  The Mexican automated station at Cayo Arcas,\nlocated to the east of the center, recently reported sustained winds\nof 48 mph (76 km/h) and a wind gust of 63 mph (101 km/h).\n\nThe minimum central pressure measured by Air Force and NOAA\nHurricane Hunter aircraft is 987 mb (29.15 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce additional rainfall\naccumulations of 1 to 3 inches across portions of the Yucatan\nPeninsula of Mexico through Monday.
