Franklin is\nmoving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A turn\ntoward the west is expected during the next several hours, with\nFranklin maintaining that motion up until landfall.  On the forecast\ntrack, the center of Franklin will move westward over the Bay of\nCampeche overnight and on Wednesday and is forecast to cross the\ncoast of the Mexican state of Veracruz Wednesday night or early\nThursday.\n\nReports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate\nthat maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is expected, and\nFranklin is forecast to become a hurricane late Wednesday and\nreach the coast of Mexico as a hurricane Wednesday night.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)\nfrom the center.  A Mexican automated weather station at Cayo\nArenas, located north of the center, recently reported a wind gust\nof 45 mph (73 km/h).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane\nHunter aircraft data is 994 mb (29.35 inches).  A Mexican automated\nweather station at Cayo Arcas, located just southwest of the center,\nrecently reported a pressure of 998.7 mb (29.49 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Franklin is expected to produce total rainfall\naccumulations of 4 to 8 inches, and isolated maximum amounts of 12\ninches are possible across portions of the Yucatan Peninsula of\nMexico through tonight.

These rains may produce life-threatening flash\nfloods and mudslides.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast within\nthe Hurricane Warning area by Wednesday night.  Winds are expected\nto first reach tropical storm strength on Wednesday, making outside\npreparations difficult or dangerous.
