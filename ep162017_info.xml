* Acapulco to Lagunas de Chacahua

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was
located inland over southern Mexico near latitude 16.8 North,
longitude 98.7 West.  Max is moving toward the east near 8 mph (13
km/h), and a turn toward the east-northeast is expected by tonight.
On the forecast track, the center of Max will move farther inland
over southern Mexico tonight.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is forecast, and Max is
expected to weaken to a tropical depression later tonight and
dissipate over southern Mexico on Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.29 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches in the Mexican state of Guerrero and western
portions of the state of Oaxaca. Maximum amounts locally in excess
of 20 inches are possible over coastal areas of Guerrero. These
torrential rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the
warning area through late tonight.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding in areas of onshore flow to the
southeast of the center of Max.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
