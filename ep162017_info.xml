DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK

At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression
Sixteen-E was located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude
101.6 West.  The depression has been moving little for the past
couple of hours, but is expected to resume a north-northeast
track near 5 mph (7 km/h) later today.  This motion will bring
the center of the depression near the coast of Mexico tonight
and then inland on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts.  No significant change in strength is anticipated before the
depression moves inland.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------

RAINFALL: The depression is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 15 inches
across southern portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero and
Michoacan.  These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

area later today.
