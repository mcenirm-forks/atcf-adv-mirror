WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for
the southwest coast of Mexico from Zihuatanejo to Punta Maldonado.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Zihuatanejo to Punta Maldonado

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 12
hours.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products
issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of newly formed Tropical
Depression Sixteen-E was located near latitude 16.2 North, longitude
101.7 West.  The depression is moving toward the north-northeast
near 5 mph (7 km/h), and this motion with a turn to the northeast is
expected during the next day or two.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
No significant change in strength is anticipated before the
depression moves inland.  Observations from the Mexican Navy
indicate that strong gusty winds are already occurring along the
coast within the tropical storm watch area.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------

RAINFALL: The depression is expected to produce total rainfall
accumulations of 5 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 15 inches
across southern portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero and
Michoacan.  These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area later today.

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.
