expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 6 to 12 hours.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products
issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was
located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 100.9 West. Radar from
Mexico indicate that Max is moving toward the east-northeast near 3
mph (6 km/h), and an east-northeastward to northeastward motion is
expected to continue today.  On the forecast track, the center of
Max will make landfall within the warning area later today.

Recent satellite data indicate that the maximum sustained winds
are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional
strengthening is possible, and Max could be near hurricane intensity
at landfall.  After landfall, Max is forecast to rapidly weaken and
dissipate by early Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 15 inches across southern
portions of the Mexican state of Guerrero and western portions of
the state of Oaxaca.  These rainfall amounts may produce life-
threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin soon within
the warning area, with hurricane conditions possible later today.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.
