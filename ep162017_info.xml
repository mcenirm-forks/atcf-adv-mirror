...HURRICANE WARNING ISSUED FOR THE SOUTHWESTERN COAST OF MEXICO...

ABOUT 55 MI...85 KM SW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 80 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of Mexico has changed the Hurricane Watch and
Tropical Storm Warning from Zihuatanejo to Punta Maldonado to a
Hurricane Warning.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Zihuatanejo to Punta Maldonado

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the next 12
hours.  Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed
to completion.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Max was located
near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 100.4 West. Max is moving
toward the east near 6 mph (9 km/h).  An east or east-northeast
motion is expected to continue until Max moves inland along the
southwestern coast of Mexico later today.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible before
Max moves inland.  Weakening is forecast after landfall.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches in the Mexican state of Guerrero and western
portions of the state of Oaxaca. Maximum amounts locally in excess
of 20 inches are possible over coastal areas of Guerrero. These
torrential rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected to begin
soon within the warning area.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.
