DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Max was located near
latitude 16.5 North, longitude 99.4 West.  Max is moving toward the
east near 8 mph (13 km/h).  An eastward or east-northeastward motion
at a similar forward speed is expected through Friday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Max is forecast to cross the coast of
southern Mexico in the hurricane warning area later today or this
evening.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is possible before the
center of Max reaches the coast later today.  Weakening is forecast
once Max makes landfall, and it is expected to dissipate over the
mountains of southern Mexico by late Friday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45
miles (75 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches in the Mexican state of Guerrero and western
portions of the state of Oaxaca. Maximum amounts locally in excess
of 20 inches are possible over coastal areas of Guerrero. These
torrential rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are likely occurring
within portions of the hurricane warning area.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected within the tropical storm warning area by
this evening, with hurricane conditions possible tonight.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.
