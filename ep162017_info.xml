DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Max was located
along the coast of eastern Guerrero near latitude 16.6 North,
longitude 99.1 West.  Max is moving toward the east near 8 mph (13
km/h), and a turn toward the east-northeast is expected by tonight.
On the forecast track, the center of Max will move farther inland
over southern Mexico.

Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Weakening is forecast, and Max should weaken to a tropical
storm this evening and dissipate over southern Mexico on Friday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches in the Mexican state of Guerrero and western
portions of the state of Oaxaca. Maximum amounts locally in excess
of 20 inches are possible over coastal areas of Guerrero. These
torrential rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are occurring within
portions of the hurricane warning area.  Tropical storm conditions
are expected within the tropical storm warning area by this evening,
with hurricane conditions possible tonight.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce
significant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the
center is making landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
