DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was
located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 101.1 West.  Max is
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h) and an
east-northeastward to northeastward motion is expected to continue
through tomorrow.  On the forecast track, the center of Max will
make landfall within the warning area on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast, and Max could
be near hurricane intensity at landfall.  After landfall, Max is
forecast to rapidly weaken and dissipate by early Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 15 inches across southern
portions of the Mexican state of Guerrero and western portions of
the state of Oaxaca.  These rainfall amounts may produce life-
threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin soon within
the warning area, with hurricane conditions possible on Thursday.
