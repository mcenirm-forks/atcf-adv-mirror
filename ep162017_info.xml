NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP162017

...MAX RAPIDLY WEAKENING OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN OF SOUTHERN MEXICO...


SUMMARY OF 100 AM CDT...0600 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.0N 98.2W
ABOUT 115 MI...180 KM E OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...E OR 85 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1004 MB...29.65 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY

The government of Mexico has discontinued the tropical storm
Warning from Acapulco to Lagunas de Chacahua.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products
issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Max
was located near latitude 17.0 North, longitude 98.2 West. The
depression is moving toward the east near 7 mph (11 km/h), and
this general motion should continue today.  On the forecast track,
the center of Max will continue to move over the high terrain of
southern Mexico during the next several hours.

The effect of the high terrain has caused Max to weaken, and
the maximum sustained winds are now 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Additional rapid weakening is forecast, and Max is expected
to dissipate later today.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Despite weakening, Max is expected to produce total
rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches in the Mexican state of
Guerrero and western portions of the state of Oaxaca. Maximum
amounts locally in excess of 20 inches are possible over coastal
areas of Guerrero. These torrential rains may produce life-
threatening flash floods and mudslides.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.
