DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was
located near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 98.5 West. Max is moving
toward the east near 7 mph (11 km/h) and this general motion should
continue through early Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Max will move farther inland over southern Mexico tonight and early
Friday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional rapid weakening is forecast, and
Max is expected to weaken to a tropical depression later tonight
and dissipate over southern Mexico early Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches in the Mexican state of Guerrero and western
portions of the state of Oaxaca. Maximum amounts locally in excess
of 20 inches are possible over coastal areas of Guerrero. These
torrential rains may produce life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the
warning area during the next few hours.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the coast of southern Mexico will
subside overnight.
