gusts.  No significant change in strength is anticipated before Max
moves inland.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).

of 5 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 15 inches across southern
