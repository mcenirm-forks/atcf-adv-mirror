At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Max was
located near latitude 16.1 North, longitude 101.4 West. Max is
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h). This motion
will bring the center of Max inland over Mexico within the warning
area on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
No significant change in strength is anticipated before Max moves
inland.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Max is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 5 to 10 inches with maximum totals of 15 inches across southern
portions of the Mexican state of Guerrero and western portions of
the state of Oaxaca.  These rainfall amounts may produce life-
threatening flash floods and mudslides.

the warning area.
