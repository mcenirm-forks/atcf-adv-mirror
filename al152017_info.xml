WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Meteorological Service of the Bahamas has discontinued the
Tropical Storm Warning for the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos
Islands.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests in the Bahamas should monitor the progress of Maria.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 24.8 North, longitude 72.0 West. Maria is moving
toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the
north is expected on Sunday.  On the forecast track, Maria should
move away from the Bahamas into the open waters of the western
Atlantic today.

Maximum sustained winds are now near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity are expected during
the next couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles
(315 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Locally gusty winds are possible across the central and
southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands today.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels in the southeastern Bahamas and the
Turks and Caicos Islands will subside as Maria moves away from those
islands.

RAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of less than one inch, with isolated maximum amounts
near 2 inches over Turks and Caicos and the eastern Bahamas through
Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These swells will begin to
increase along portions of the southeastern United States coast and
Bermuda today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
