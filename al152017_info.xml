WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests in the Bahamas and along the Carolina and Mid-Atlantic
coasts should monitor the progress of Maria.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 25.4 North, longitude 72.3 West.  Maria is moving
toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), but a turn toward
the north is expected by this evening.  A northward motion with a
decrease in forward speed is forecast to then continue through
Monday.  On the forecast track, Maria will move away from the
Bahamas into the open waters of the western Atlantic today.

Data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate that
maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 115 mph (185 km/h)
with higher  gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is
forecast during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195
miles (315 km).

The minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 952 mb (28.12
inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are increasing along portions of
the southeastern United States coast and Bermuda and will be
increasing along the Mid-Atlantic coast tonight and Sunday.  Swells
also continue to affect Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the
Bahamas.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office for more information.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.
