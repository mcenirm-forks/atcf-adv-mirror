DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the large eye of Hurricane Maria was
located near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 68.4 West.  Maria is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion is expected through tonight.  A turn toward the
north-northwest is forecast on Friday.  On the forecast track, the
eye of Hurricane Maria will continue to pass offshore of the
northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic today.  Maria should
then move near the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern
Bahamas tonight and Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is possible during the
next day or so.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).  Punta Cana in the eastern Dominican Republic recently
reported a wind gust to 56 mph (91 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 959 mb (28.32 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Strong gusty winds are still occurring over portions of
Puerto Rico, but should continue to gradually subside this morning.
Tropical storm or hurricane conditions are continuing across
portions of the warning areas in the Dominican Republic.  Hurricane
conditions are expected to begin in portions of the Turks and Caicos
Islands and the southeastern Bahamas tonight, with tropical storm
conditions beginning in these areas later today.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels in Puerto Rico should continue receding
during the next few hours.

A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves
will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide
levels in the hurricane warning area in the Dominican Republic, and
1 to 3 ft elsewhere along the northern coasts of the Dominican
Republic and Haiti.

A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves
will raise water levels by as much as 9 to 12 feet above normal
tide levels within the hurricane warning area of the southeastern
Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

RAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through Saturday:

Puerto Rico...additional 4 to 8 inches, isolated maximum storm total
amounts 35 inches.
U.S. and British Virgin Islands...additional 2 to 4 inches.
Northern and eastern Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos, and
Mayaguana in southeast Bahamas...8 to 16 inches, isolated 20 inches.
Inagua Islands, Crooked Island, and rest of southeast Bahamas...4 to
8 inches.
Northern Haiti...2 to 4 inches.

Rainfall on these islands will continue to cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are still affecting the Leeward
Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  These swells are
also affecting the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and should begin in the Southeastern Bahamas later
today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
