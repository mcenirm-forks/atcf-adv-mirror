DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the large eye of Hurricane Maria was
located near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 68.2 West.  Maria is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through
tonight.  A turn toward the north-northwest is forecast on Friday.
On the forecast track, the core of Hurricane Maria will continue to
move away from Puerto Rico during the next several hours, and then
pass offshore of the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic
early today.  Maria should then move near the Turks and Caicos
Islands and the southeastern Bahamas tonight and Friday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 115 mph (185 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening
is possible over the next day or so.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).  Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic recently
reported a wind gust to 58 mph (93 km/h).

The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane
Hunter observations is 959 mb (28.32 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Strong gusty winds are still occurring over portions of
Puerto Rico, but should continue to gradually subside.  Tropical
storm or hurricane conditions are spreading across portions of the
warning areas in the Dominican Republic.  Hurricane conditions are
expected to begin in portions of the Turks and Caicos Islands and
the southeastern Bahamas tonight, with tropical storm conditions
beginning in these areas later today.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels in Puerto Rico should continue receding
during the next few hours.

A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves
will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide
levels in the hurricane warning area in the Dominican Republic, and
1 to 3 ft elsewhere along the northern coasts of the Dominican
Republic and Haiti.

A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves
will raise water levels by as much as 9 to 12 feet above normal
tide levels within the hurricane warning area of the southeastern
Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

RAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce the following
rainfall totals through Saturday:

Puerto Rico...20 to 30 inches, isolated 35 inches.
U.S. and British Virgin Islands...additional 3 to 5 inches.
Northern and eastern Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos, and the
Southeastern Bahamas...8 to 16 inches, isolated 20 inches.
Northern Haiti...2 to 4 inches.

Rainfall on these islands will continue to cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are still affecting the Leeward
Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  These swells are
also affecting the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and should begin in the Southeastern Bahamas during
the next day or two.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
