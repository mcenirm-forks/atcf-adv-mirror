CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests along the Carolina and Mid-Atlantic coasts should monitor
the progress of Maria.  Tropical storm or hurricane watches may be
needed for a portion of the coast on Sunday.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 26.3 North, longitude 72.5 West.  Maria is moving
toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), but a turn toward
the north is expected by tonight.   A northward motion with a
decrease in forward speed is forecast to then continue through
Monday.  On the forecast track, Maria will move away from the
Bahamas and offshore of the southeastern coast of the United
States.

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  A gradual weakening trend is expected to
begin late Sunday or Monday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240
miles (390 km).

The minimum central pressure from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter plane is
950 mb (28.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are increasing along portions of
the southeastern United States coast and Bermuda and will be
increasing along the Mid-Atlantic coast tonight and Sunday.  Swells
also continue to affect Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the
Bahamas.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office for more information.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.
