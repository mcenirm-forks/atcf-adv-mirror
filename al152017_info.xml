A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands and the Southeastern Bahamas

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Central Bahamas

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  Preparations to protect life and

expected somewhere within the warning area.

Interests elsewhere in the Bahamas should monitor the progress of

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 71.0 West.  Maria is moving
toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northwest is expected later today, followed by a turn toward
the north by late Saturday.  On the forecast track, Maria's core
will move away from the Turks and Caicos Islands today, and pass
northeast and east of the Bahamas through Sunday.

Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that maximum sustained winds remain near 125 mph (205 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  A gradual weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).

The minimum central pressure based on data from the reconnaissance
aircraft is 958 mb (28.29 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are occurring over
portions of the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern
Bahamas and will continue through tonight.  Tropical storm
conditions are expected in the central Bahamas beginning tonight.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and
destructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 9 to 12 feet
above normal tide levels within the hurricane warning area of the
southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

RAINFALL:  Maria is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through Saturday:

Turks and Caicos...8 to 16 inches, isolated 20 inches
Puerto Rico...additional 3 to 6 inches, isolated maximum storm
total amounts 40 inches
Eastern Dominican Republic...additional 4 to 8 inches, isolated
storm total amounts 20 inches
Western Dominican Republic and northern Haiti...additional 3 to 6
inches
Mayaguana, southeast Bahamas...4 to 8 inches
Inagua Islands and Crooked Island, Bahamas...2 to 6 inches
Rest of eastern Bahamas...1 to 3 inches

Rainfall on these islands will continue to cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These swells will reach portions
of the United States southeastern coast today and Bermuda tonight.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
