DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 14.6 North, longitude 59.7 West. Maria is moving
toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this motion
with a decrease in forward speed is expected through Tuesday night.
On the forecast track, the center of Maria will move across the
Leeward Islands late today and tonight, and then over the extreme
northeastern Caribbean Sea Tuesday and Tuesday night.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 110 mph
(175 km/h) with higher gusts.  Maria is currently a Category 2
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional
rapid strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Maria
is expected to become a dangerous major hurricane before it moves
through the Leeward Islands.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105
miles (165 km).

The minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft data is 967 mb (28.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are first expected within portions of
the Leeward Islands by late today, with tropical storm conditions
beginning during the next several hours.  Hurricane conditions are
possible within the hurricane watch area by Tuesday, with tropical
storm conditions possible tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the tropical storm watch area through tonight.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and
destructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 5 to 7 feet
above normal tide levels near where the center of Maria moves
across the Leeward Islands.

RAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 12 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches across the
central and southern Leeward Islands, including Puerto Rico and the
U.S. and British Virgin Islands, through Wednesday night.  Maria is
also expected to produce total rain accumulations of 2 to 4 inches
with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches over the remaining
northern Leeward Islands from Barbuda to Anguilla, as well as the
Windward Islands and Barbados.  Rainfall on all of these islands
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting the Lesser Antilles.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
