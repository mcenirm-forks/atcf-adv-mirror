Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Maria was
located near latitude 34.1 North, longitude 73.0 West.  Maria is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected through
tonight.  A turn toward the north-northeast is expected on
Wednesday, and a turn toward the east-northeast is anticipated on
Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Maria will pass east
of the coast of North Carolina during the next day or so.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some slight weakening is forecast during the
next day or two.

Maria is a large tropical storm. Tropical-storm-force winds extend
outward up to 230 miles (370 km) from the center.  NOAA buoy 41025
located about 15 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras recently reported
a sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) with a gust to 52 mph
(83 km/h).  A wind gust to 41 mph (66 km/h) was recently reported
at Manteo, North Carolina.

The latest minimum central pressure reported by a NOAA
reconnaissance aircraft is 974 mb (28.77 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
through Wednesday.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Cape Lookout to Duck including the sound side of the Outer
Banks...2 to 4 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Maria is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 1 to 2 inches over the Outer Banks of North Carolina through
Wednesday.

SURF:  Large swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the
east coast of the United States.  These swells are also affecting
Bermuda, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office
for more information.
