DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 36.2 North, longitude 72.1 West.  Maria is moving
toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue tonight.  Maria is forecast to accelerate
east-northeastward on Thursday through Friday.  On the forecast
track, Maria will move away from the coast of North Carolina
through Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
primarily to the northeast of the center, and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area through the next few hours.  These winds should diminish later
this evening.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the North Carolina Outer Banks
will gradually subside tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the
east coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the
Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office for more
information.
