WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Maria was
located near latitude 36.8 North, longitude 71.0 West.  Maria is
moving toward the east-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and the
storm is expected to accelerate eastward through tonight.  A turn
back toward the east-northeast with an additional increase in
forward speed is expected on Friday.  On the forecast track, Maria
will move away from the U.S. east coast and pass well to the south
of Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the
next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the east
coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada, and Bermuda.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office
for more information.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.
