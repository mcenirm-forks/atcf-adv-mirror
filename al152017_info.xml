dangerous.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, including the British

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Maria was
located near latitude 13.6 North, longitude 56.9 West.  Maria is
moving toward the west-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through Tuesday.
On the forecast track, the center of Maria will move across the
Leeward Islands Monday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and
Maria is expected to become a hurricane later today or tonight.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are first expected within portions of
the Leeward Islands by Monday night, with tropical storm conditions
beginning on Monday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within the
hurricane watch area by Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions
possible Monday night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in
the tropical storm watch area Monday or Monday night.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and
destructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet
above normal tide levels near where the center of Maria moves
across the Leeward Islands.

RAINFALL:  Maria is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
6 to 12 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches across the
Leeward Islands, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. and
British Virgin Islands through Wednesday night.  Maria is also
expected to produce total rain accumulations of 2 to 4 inches for
the northern and central Windward Islands.  In all the above areas,
these rainfall amounts could cause life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are beginning to affect the Lesser
Antilles.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
