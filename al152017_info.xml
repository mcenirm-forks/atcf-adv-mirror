CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
* Southeastern Bahamas
* Central Bahamas

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

Interests elsewhere in the Bahamas should monitor the progress of
Maria.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the large eye of Hurricane Maria was
located near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 71.9 West. Maria is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and a
gradual turn to the north should begin later today.  This motion
will bring the core of Maria east of the Bahamas today, and then
over the open waters of the western Atlantic.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected
through tonight, with a gradual weakening expected to begin on
Sunday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).

The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter aircraft was 952 mb (28.11 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are still likely over portions of
the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas during the
next several hours, but should subside later today. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in portions of the central Bahamas today.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels in the southeastern Bahamas and the
Turks and Caicos Islands will subside as Maria moves away from those
islands.

RAINFALL:  Rains are expected to gradually diminish across portions
of the Turks and Caicos as well as the eastern Bahamas as Maria
continues to move north of those islands today.  Additional rainfall
amounts of an inch or less are expected over those areas today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These swells will begin to
increase along portions of the southeastern United States coast and
Bermuda today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
