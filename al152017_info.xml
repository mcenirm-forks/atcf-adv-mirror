WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests along the Carolina and Mid-Atlantic coasts should monitor
the progress of Maria.  Tropical storm or hurricane watches may be
needed for a portion of the coast later today.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 27.9 North, longitude 72.7 West.  Maria is moving
toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion is
expected to continue through Monday.  On the forecast track, the
core of Maria will be moving well east of the United States
southeast coast during the next two days.

Reports from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum
sustained winds are now near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher gusts.
Maria is a category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind
Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely during the next
day or so.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles
(390 km).  During the past several hours, NOAA buoy 41047 located
to the east of the center reported sustained winds of 68 mph
(109 km/h) and a wind gust of 85 mph (137 km/h).

The minimum central pressure reported by the NOAA Hurricane Hunter
is 948 mb (28.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are increasing along portions of
the southeastern United States coast and Bermuda and will be
increasing along the Mid-Atlantic coast later today.  Swells also
continue to affect Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the northern
coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office for more information.
