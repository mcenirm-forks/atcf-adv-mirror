SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
* Southeastern Bahamas
* Central Bahamas

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

Interests elsewhere in the Bahamas should monitor the progress of
Maria.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products
issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the large eye of Hurricane Maria was
located near latitude 24.1 North, longitude 71.7 West. Maria is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), but a
gradual turn to the north should begin on Saturday. This forecast
will bring the core of Maria east of the Bahamas on Saturday, and
then over the open waters of the western Atlantic.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  No important changes in intensity are
expected on Saturday, but gradual weakening should begin on Sunday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles
(295 km).

The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane
Hunter plane was 954 mb (28.17 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are still likely over portions of
the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas during the
next several hours, but should subside on Saturday. Tropical storm
conditions are expected in portions of the central Bahamas on
Saturday.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels in the southeastern Bahamas and the
Turks and Caicos Islands will subside as Maria moves away from those
islands.

RAINFALL:  Rains are expected to gradually diminish across portions
of the Turks and Caicos as well as the eastern Bahamas as Maria
continues to move north of those islands Friday night and Saturday.
Additional rainfall amounts of an inch or less are expected over
those areas through Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These swells will begin to
increase along portions of the southeastern United States coast and
Bermuda tonight and Saturday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
