* Ocracoke Inlet to the North Carolina/Virginia border
* Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds

A Storm Surge Watch is in effect for...

A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline in
the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at risk, please
see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.
Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions
to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

A Storm Surge Watch means there is a possibility of life-
threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the
coastline in the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at
risk, please see the National Weather Service Storm Surge
Watch/Warning Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 35.9 North, longitude 72.4 West. Maria is moving
toward the north-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue today. Maria is forecast to accelerate
east-northeastward on Thursday and Thursday night. On the forecast
track, Maria will move away from the coast of North Carolina
through Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
primary to the northeast of the center, and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km). An observing site at
Jennette's Pier in Nags Head, North Carolina, recently reported a
sustained wind of 44 mph (70 km/h) and a gust of 54 mph (87 km/h).

The latest minimum central pressure reported by reconnaissance
aircraft data is 979 mb (28.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area through today.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Ocracoke Inlet to Duck including the sound side of the Outer
Banks...2 to 4 ft

Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge
and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For
information specific to your area, please see products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office.

SURF:  Large swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the
east coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the
Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office for more
information.
