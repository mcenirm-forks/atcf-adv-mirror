SUMMARY OF 800 PM EDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Turks and Caicos Islands
* Southeastern Bahamas
* Central Bahamas

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

Interests elsewhere in the Bahamas should monitor the progress of
Maria.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products
issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 23.8 North, longitude 71.6 West.  Maria is moving
toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through Saturday.  A turn toward the
north is forecast by Saturday night.

We are fortunate tonight to have an Air Force and a NOAA Hurricane
Hunter aircraft sampling Maria. In fact, a Coyote unmanned aerial
vehicle launched from the NOAA P3 aircraft successfully measured
winds in the eyewall. Data from these platforms indicate that the
maximum sustained winds remain near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km).

The minimum central pressure based on data from both reconnaissance
planes is 953 mb (28.14 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the
Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas through
tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in
portions of the central Bahamas tonight.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels in the southeastern Bahamas and the
Turks and Caicos Islands will subside through tonight as Maria
moves away from those islands.

RAINFALL:  Maria is expected to produce the following rainfall
accumulations through Saturday:

Turks and Caicos...8 to 16 inches, isolated 20 inches
Puerto Rico...additional 1 to 3 inches, isolated maximum storm total
amounts 40 inches
Mayaguana, southeast Bahamas...4 to 8 inches
Inagua Islands and Crooked Island, Bahamas...2 to 6 inches
Rest of eastern Bahamas...1 to 3 inches

Rainfall on these islands will continue to cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are still affecting Puerto Rico,
the Virgin Islands, the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and
Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These swells will begin to
increase along portions of the southeastern United States coast and
Bermuda tonight.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
