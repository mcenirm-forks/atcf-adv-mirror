All Storm Surge Watches and Warnings have been discontinued.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Maria was located
near latitude 36.5 North, longitude 71.8 West.  Maria is moving
toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue overnight.  Maria is forecast to accelerate
east-northeastward on Thursday through Friday.  On the forecast
track, Maria will move away from the U.S. east coast through
Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
primarily to the northeast of the center, and tropical-storm-force
winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the
east coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the
Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office for more
information.
