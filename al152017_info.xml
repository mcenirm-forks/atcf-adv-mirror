WATCHES AND WARNINGS

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Maria was
located near latitude 37.2 North, longitude 63.3 West.  Maria is
moving toward the east near 21 mph (33 km/h).  A turn toward the
east-northeast at an even faster forward speed is expected later
today, and Maria will continue to accelerate toward the north
Atlantic Ocean through at least Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next
48 hours, but Maria is expected to become an extratropical low by
Saturday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255 miles (405 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the east
coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada, and Bermuda.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office
for more information.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.
