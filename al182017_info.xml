For storm information specific to your area in the United

monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside
the United States, please monitor products issued by your national
meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
estimated near latitude 27.6 North, longitude 79.0 West.  Philippe
has accelerated and is now moving toward the northeast near 32 mph
(52 km/h). This general motion is expected to continue through
Monday. On the forecast track, the center of Philippe will continue
to move quickly away from the Florida east coast and the
northwestern Bahamas this morning, and then move over the open
western Atlantic by this afternoon.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts. Some additional slight strengthening is forecast
during the next day or so.  However, Philippe is expected to become
a post-tropical cyclone by tonight, and be absorbed by an
extratropical low on Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.  Recent ship observations indicate that
tropical-storm-force winds of 40 to 50 mph (65 to 83 km/h) are
occurring across the waters in and near the northwestern Bahamas.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on nearby surface
observations is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Philippe is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the northern Bahamas and
eastern Cuba. This rainfall could cause flash flooding, especially
in urban areas and in the mountainous terrain of Cuba.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to end in the warning
area in Cuba this morning.  Tropical storm conditions should
continue across portions of the warning area in the northwestern
Bahamas this morning, but end by early afternoon.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.
