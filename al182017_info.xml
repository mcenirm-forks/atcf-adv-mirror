A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Cuban provinces of Isla de la Juventud, La Habana, Ciudad de la
Habana, Matanzas, Cienfuegos, and Villa Clara
* Northwestern Bahamas

For storm information specific to your area outside the United
States, please monitor products issued by your national
meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
estimated near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 81.0 West.  Philippe
is moving toward the east-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A turn
toward the northeast is expected during the next few hours,  and
a rapid motion toward the northeast is expected through Monday.
On the forecast track, the center of Philippe will move across the
southern tip of the Florida peninsula this morning, and then across
the northwestern Bahamas later today.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next day or so.  However,
Philippe is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone by tonight,
and to become absorbed by an extratropical low on Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Philippe is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the northern Bahamas and
eastern Cuba, and additional rain accumulations of less than 1 inch
over south Florida.  This rainfall could cause flash flooding,
especially in urban areas and in the mountainous terrain of Cuba.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to end in the warning
area in Cuba this morning.  Tropical storm conditions are expected
in portions of the warning area in the northwestern Bahamas later
this morning.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.
