WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Meteorological Service of Cuba has discontinued the Tropical
Storm Warning for Cuba.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Northwestern Bahamas

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Philippe was
located near latitude 27.8 North, longitude 77.5 West. Philippe is
moving toward the east-northeast near 31 mph (50 km/h). A motion
toward the northeast at a faster forward speed is expected to begin
later this afternoon and continue through Monday. On the forecast
track, the center of Philippe will continue to move quickly away
from the Florida east coast and the northwestern Bahamas and emerge
over the open western Atlantic later this afternoon, remaining well
away from the United States and Bermuda.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so.
However, Philippe is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone by
tonight, and be absorbed by a large extratropical low on Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195 miles (315 km)
from the center. Recent ship observations continue to indicate that
tropical-storm-force winds of 40 to 50 mph (65 to 83 km/h) are
occurring across the waters in and near the northwestern Bahamas.
In addition, sustained winds of 35 mph (56 km/h) and gusts to 51 mph
(81 km/h) have been occurring at Settlement Point on the western end
of Grand Bahama Island during the past couple of hours.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on nearby surface
observations is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Philippe is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over eastern Cuba. This rainfall
could cause flash flooding, especially in urban areas and in the
mountainous terrain of Cuba. The heavy rainfall threat for the
Bahamas has diminished

WIND: Tropical storm conditions should continue across portions of
the warning area in the northwestern Bahamas this morning, but end
by early afternoon.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.
