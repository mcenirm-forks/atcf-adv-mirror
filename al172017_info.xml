DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the distinct eye of Hurricane Ophelia was
located near latitude 34.8 North, longitude 26.6 West.  Ophelia is
moving toward the northeast near 25 mph (41 km/h), and this motion
is expected continue through Sunday with a turn toward the
north-northeast thereafter.  On the forecast track, the core of
Ophelia will pass to the south and southeast of the southeastern
Azores by tonight.

Satellite data indicate that the maximum sustained winds have
increased near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Ophelia is a
category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
No significant change in strength is expected today, but gradual
weakening should begin tonight or Sunday.  However, Ophelia is still
expected to remain a powerful cyclone with hurricane force winds for
the next couple of days as it approaches Ireland.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are possible throughout the Azores
beginning this afternoon or tonight, primarily due to an approaching
cold front.

RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches over the central and southeastern Azores through
Saturday night.

Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.
