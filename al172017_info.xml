WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Ophelia was located
near latitude 30.4 North, longitude 35.5 West. Ophelia is currently
meandering, but a east-northeast motion is expected to begin
tonight.  A east-northeast motion is forecast to continue after that
with a substantial increase in forward speed by this weekend.  On
the forecast track, the center of Ophelia will remain south of the
Azores through Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 48
hours, but Ophelia is expected to remain a hurricane for the next
couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).



HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches over Santa Maria Island of the Azores Saturday and
Saturday night.  During the same time, a cold front and moisture
associated with Ophelia is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the other islands of the Azores.
This rainfall could produce flooding, especially over Santa Maria
Island.
