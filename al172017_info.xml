SATURDAY EVENING...


SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...33.0N 30.6W
ABOUT 400 MI...645 KM SSW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal tropical cyclone watches or warnings in effect.

Azores Weather Forecast and Watch Center.

Interests in Ireland should monitor products issued by Met Eireann,
and interests in the United Kingdom should monitor products issued
by the UK Met Office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Ophelia was located
near latitude 33.0 North, longitude 30.6 West. Ophelia is moving
toward the east-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h), and a continued
east-northeast motion with an increase in forward speed is forecast
through Saturday evening.  A turn toward the northeast is expected
on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the core of Ophelia will pass
south of the southeastern Azores by late Saturday or early Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Ophelia is expected to remain a powerful cyclone for the
next couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are possible throughout the Azores
beginning late Saturday or Saturday night, primarily due to an
approaching cold front.

RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches over the southeastern Azores through Saturday
night.  During the same time, a cold front and moisture associated
with Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to
3 inches over the other islands of the Azores.  This rainfall could
produce flooding, especially over the southeastern Azores.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.
