ABOUT 615 MI...995 KM SW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

should monitor products issued by Met Eireann, and interests in the
United Kingdom should monitor products issued by the UK Met Office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ophelia was
located near latitude 31.1 North, longitude 33.9 West.  Ophelia is
moving toward the east-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this
motion with an increase in forward speed is expected through
Saturday.  A turn toward the northeast with an additional increase
in forward speed is expected Saturday night.  On the forecast
track, the center of Ophelia will pass near or to the southeast of
the southeastern Azores Saturday and Saturday night.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Only slight weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches over the southeastern Azores Saturday and Saturday
night.  During the same time, a cold front and moisture associated
with Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to
3 inches over the other islands of the Azores.  This rainfall could
produce flooding, especially over the southeastern Azores.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.
