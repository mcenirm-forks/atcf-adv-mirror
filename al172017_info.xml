Hurricane Ophelia Advisory Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172017
500 PM AST Sat Oct 14 2017

...EYE OF HURRICANE OPHELIA PASSING SOUTH OF THE AZORES...
...EXPECTED TO BECOME POST-TROPICAL LATE SUNDAY OR EARLY MONDAY...


SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...35.9N 23.7W
ABOUT 235 MI...375 KM SE OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 55 DEGREES AT 28 MPH...44 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...960 MB...28.35 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal tropical cyclone watches or warnings in effect.

Interests in the Azores should refer to products issued by the
Azores Weather Forecast and Watch Center.

Interests in Ireland should monitor products issued by Met Eireann,
and interests in the United Kingdom should monitor products issued
by the UK Met Office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the clear eye of Hurricane Ophelia was
located near latitude 35.9 North, longitude 23.7 West. Ophelia is
moving toward the northeast near 28 mph (44 km/h).  A continued
northeast motion with an increase in forward speed is expected
tonight and Sunday, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast
Sunday night.  On the forecast track, the core of Ophelia will
continue to pass south and east of the Azores tonight.

Satellite data indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 115
mph (185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Ophelia is a category 3 hurricane
on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in
strength is expected tonight, but the hurricane is likely to become
post-tropical by early Monday morning, if not sooner.  Ophelia is
forecast to remain a powerful cyclone with hurricane-force winds
as it approaches Ireland.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).  The wind field of Ophelia is forecast to expand
substantially and wind and rain effects in Ireland and the UK are
expected to reach the coast well before the arrival of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are possible throughout the Azores
through tonight, primarily due to a cold front currently passing
through the islands.

RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 1 to 3 inches over the central and southeastern Azores through
Saturday night.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.
