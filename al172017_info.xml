Interests in Ireland should monitor products issued by Met Eireann,
and interests in the United Kingdom should monitor products issued
by the UK Met Office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ophelia was
located near latitude 37.3 North, longitude 21.5 West. Ophelia is
moving toward the northeast near 28 mph (44 km/h).  A continued
northeast motion with an increase in forward speed is expected
tonight and Sunday, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast
Sunday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Ophelia will
continue to pass east of the Azores tonight, and approach Ireland
on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Ophelia is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Gradual weakening is forecast to begin
later tonight, but Ophelia is forecast to become a post-tropical
cyclone with hurricane-force winds as it approaches Ireland on
Monday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are possible throughout the Azores
through tonight, primarily due to a cold front that has passed
through the islands.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.
