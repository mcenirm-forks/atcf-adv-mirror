EAST-NORTHEAST...


SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.3N 31.8W
ABOUT 480 MI...770 KM SW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal tropical cyclone watches or warnings in effect.

Interests in the Azores should refer to products issued by the
Azores Weather Forecast and Watch Center.

Interests in Ireland should monitor products issued by Met Eireann,
and interests in the United Kingdom should monitor products issued
by the UK Met Office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Ophelia was located
near latitude 32.3 North, longitude 31.8 West. Ophelia is moving
toward the east-northeast near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A continued
east-northeast motion with an increase in forward speed is forecast
through Saturday evening.  A turn toward the northeast is expected
on Sunday.  On the forecast track, the center of Ophelia will pass
near or southeast of the southeastern Azores by early Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours and Ophelia is expected to remain a powerful cyclone for the
next couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are possible throughout the Azores
beginning late Saturday or Saturday night due to an approaching
cold front.

RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches over the southeastern Azores through Saturday
night.  During the same time, a cold front and moisture associated
with Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to
3 inches over the other islands of the Azores.  This rainfall could
produce flooding, especially over the southeastern Azores.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.
