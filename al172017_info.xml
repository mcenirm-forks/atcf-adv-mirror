NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172017

...SMALL BUT POWERFUL OPHELIA WITH 105-MPH WINDS OVER THE EASTERN
ATLANTIC...


SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...30.7N 34.7W
ABOUT 670 MI...1075 KM SW OF THE AZORES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...ENE OR 60 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests in the Azores should refer to products issued by the
Azores Weather Forecast and Watch Center.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Ophelia was located
near latitude 30.7 North, longitude 34.7 West. Ophelia is moving
toward the east-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days with a
large increase in forward speed.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some slow weakening is forecast to begin Friday
night but Ophelia should remain a hurricane for the next couple of
days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches over the southeastern Azores Saturday and Saturday
night.  During the same time, a cold front and moisture associated
with Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to
3 inches over the other islands of the Azores. This rainfall could
produce flooding, especially over the southeastern Azores.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.
