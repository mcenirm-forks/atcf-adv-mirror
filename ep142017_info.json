Lidia is\nmoving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this\ngeneral motion is expected to continue through midday Friday.  A\nturn toward the northwest at a faster forward speed is expected by\nFriday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Lidia will be\nnear the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula this\nafternoon, and it will move over the peninsula Friday and Friday\nnight.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast for the\nnext 24 hours or so before Lidia's center reaches the Baja\nCalifornia peninsula.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)\nto the east of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n8 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur and\nwestern Jalisco, with isolated maximum totals of 20 inches.  In the\nMexican states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Colima, southern Michoacan,\nsouthern Sonora, and central Jalisco, rainfall amounts of 3 to 6\ninches are expected. These rains are expected to cause\nlife-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the\ncoast within the warning area in Baja California Sur later this\nmorning, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous.\nHurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area\nlate today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning\narea in mainland Mexico starting later today or tonight.  Tropical\nstorm conditions are possible in the watch areas late Friday.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal\nflooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja\nCalifornia Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by\nlarge and destructive waves.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast\nof southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja\nCalifornia Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions. Please consult products from your local weather\noffice.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 600 AM MDT.\nNext complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
