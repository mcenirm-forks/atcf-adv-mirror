A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are\npossible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nInterests elsewhere in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur\nshould monitor the progress of this system.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor\nproducts issued by your national meteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the disturbance was centered near\nlatitude 18.1 North, longitude 108.2 West.  The system is moving\ntoward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A slower northwest to\nnorth-northwest motion is expected during the next couple of days.\nOn the forecast track, the center of the disturbance will be near\nthe southern tip of the Baja California peninsula by late Thursday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 30 mph (45 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  The system is expected to strengthen to a tropical storm\nlater today, and it could become a hurricane by late Thursday.\n\nThe disturbance continues to show signs of organization, and only a\nsmall increase in the definition of the circulation would lead to\nthe formation of a tropical cyclone.\n* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...near 100 percent\n* Formation chance through 5 days...high...near 100 percent\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the\ncoast within the warning area by late today or tonight, making\noutside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Hurricane conditions\nare also possible within the watch area on Thursday.\nTropical-storm-force wind gusts are possible in rainbands along the\ncoast of Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco today.\n\nRAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce total rain\naccumulations of 5 to 10 inches in the Mexican states of Michoacan,\nColima, Jalisco and Nayarit, with isolated maximum totals of 20\ninches possible along the immediate coast.  This rain could cause\nlife-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by the disturbance are affecting portions of\nthe coast of southwestern Mexico.  These swells will likely reach\nthe southern portions of Baja California Sur later today, and could\ncause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please\nconsult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
