Lidia is\nmoving toward the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this\nmotion is expected to continue through today. On the forecast track,\nthe center of Lidia will move near or over the Baja California\npeninsula through Saturday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  A gradual weakening is forecast, but Lidia is anticipated to\nremain a tropical storm during the next day or so.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles (295 km)\nmainly to the northeast and southeast of the center.  A sustained\nwind of 54 mph (87 km/h) and a wind gust to 68 mph (109 km/h) were\nrecently reported at Cabo Pulmo, Baja California Sur.  A wind gust\nto 45 mph (72 km/h) was recently measured at Topolobampo, Sinaloa,\non the eastern side of the Gulf of California.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based on surface\nobservations from southern Baja California Sur is 987 mb (29.15\ninches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n6 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur into\nBaja California, Sinaloa and the coastal section of Sonora, with\nisolated maximum amounts of 20 inches. These rains may cause\nlife-threatening flash floods and mudslides. Some of the tropical\nmoisture from Lidia may reach parts of the desert Southwest this\nholiday weekend, including southern California, southern Nevada and\nsouthwestern Arizona.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring over the southern\nportion of Baja California Sur at this time.  These conditions\nshould spread northward across the warning area through Friday\nnight. Hurricane conditions are still possible within the hurricane\nwatch area during the next few hours.  Tropical storm conditions are\nexpected in the warning area in mainland Mexico through Friday.\nTropical storm conditions are possible in the watch areas Friday\nnight or Saturday.  Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of\nhills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the\nnear-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated\nlocations could be even greater.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal\nflooding in areas of onshore winds on the southern portion of Baja\nCalifornia Sur.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by\nlarge and destructive waves.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast\nof southwestern and western Mexico and southern portions of Baja\nCalifornia Sur, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions. Please consult products from your local weather\noffice.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
