Lidia is\nmoving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this\nmotion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. On\nthe forecast track, the center of Lidia will be near the southern\ntip of the Baja California peninsula by late Thursday, and\nmoving across the peninsula on Friday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.\nSome strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours, and\nLidia still has the opportunity to be near hurricane strength\nnear the southern portion of the Baja California peninsula.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)\nfrom the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Lidia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n8 to 12 inches across the Mexican states of Baja California Sur and\nwestern Jalisco, with isolated maximum totals of 20 inches.  In the\nMexican states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Colima, southern Michoacan,\nsouthern Sonora and central Jalisco, rainfall amounts of 3 to 6\ninches are expected. These rains are expected to cause\nlife-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the\ncoast within the warning area by early Thursday, making outside\npreparations difficult or dangerous.  Hurricane conditions are\npossible within the hurricane watch area late Thursday.  Tropical\nstorm conditions are possible in the warning area in mainland Mexico\nstarting late on Thursday, and in the watch areas in Baja California\nSur on Friday.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce\nsignificant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds on the\nsouthern portion of Baja California Sur. Near the coast, the\nsurge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Lidia are affecting portions of the coast\nof southwestern and western Mexico.  These swells will reach the\nsouthern portions of Baja California Sur tonight, and could cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 1200 AM MDT.\nNext complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
