DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the disturbance was centered near
latitude 32.5 North, longitude 80.0 West.  The system is moving
toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A faster
northeast motion is expected during the next couple of days.  On
the forecast track, the system will move near or over the coast of
South Carolina tonight and across the North Carolina Outer Banks on
Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  The disturbance is not expected to change much in strength
tonight or early Tuesday and the chances for the system to become a
tropical cyclone appear to be decreasing.  Regardless of whether or
not this system becomes a tropical cyclone, tropical-storm-force
winds and heavy rains are expected over portions of the Carolinas
during the next day or so.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
southeast of the center.

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

area tonight and Tuesday and tropical storm conditions are possible
in the watch area tonight.

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 3 to 6 inches along northeastern South
Carolina, North Carolina, and southeast Virginia coasts, with
possible isolated maximum amounts of 9 inches.  The heavier rains
may result in some flooding concerns along coastal areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by this disturbance will affect portions of
the South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia coasts during the
next day or so, creating dangerous surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tuesday along the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts.
