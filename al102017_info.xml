CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* South Santee River to Duck
* Albemarle Sound
* Pamlico Sound

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 24 to
48 hours.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
30.9 North, longitude 80.3 West.  The system is currently
stationary.  A slow northward motion is expected overnight and
Monday, followed by a faster northeastward motion Monday night and
Tuesday. On the forecast track, the system will move slowly offshore
of the South Carolina coast tonight and Monday, and then move along
or near the northeastern coast of South Carolina and the North
Carolina coast Monday night and Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and the
system is expected to become a tropical storm later tonight or
Monday.  The disturbance is expected to become post-tropical on
Tuesday.

Satellite and radar data indicate that the associated showers and
thunderstorms continue to be well organized, but the center of
circulation is not yet well defined.  Only a slight increase in the
definition of the circulation would lead to the formation of a
tropical cyclone.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent

The estimated minimum central pressure based on buoy data is 1007
mb (29.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area Monday night through Tuesday.

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches along the South Carolina, North
Carolina, and southeast Virginia coasts, with isolated possible
maximum amounts of 6 inches.
