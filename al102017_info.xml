DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude
33.5 North, longitude 78.5 West.  The system is moving toward the
northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h), and is anticipated to turn toward
the east-northeast and accelerate during the next couple of days.
The expected track will take the system along the North Carolina
coast today before moving out to sea tonight.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  The disturbance is not expected to change much in strength
today and the chances for the system to become a tropical cyclone
appear to be decreasing.  Regardless of whether or not this system
becomes a tropical cyclone, tropical-storm-force winds and heavy
rains are expected over portions of North Carolina later today.
* Formation chance through 48 hours... medium...50 percent
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area this afternoon and tropical storm conditions are possible
in the watch area later this morning.

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches with isolated amounts of 5 inches
along northeastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia coasts into
the Delmarva through Wednesday.  The heavier rains may result in
some flooding concerns along coastal areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by this disturbance will affect portions of
the North Carolina  and Virginia coasts during the next day or so,
creating dangerous surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A brief tornado is possible through midday along the
North Carolina coast.
