For storm information specific to your area, including possible

local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the elongated area of low pressure
associated with the disturbance was centered near latitude
31.8 North, longitude 80.3 West. The system is moving toward the
north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a gradual turn to the north-
northeast and northeast with a gradual increase in forward speed
are expected during the next couple of days. On the forecast
track, the system will move over or near the coast of South Carolina
today and move along the North Carolina Outer Banks on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. These winds are occuring over water well to the east of
the broad area of low pressure. Although the disturbance has
not shown any significant increase in organization today, conditions
still favor the system becoming a tropical storm later today or
Tuesday.  An Air Force plane is currently investigating the
disturbance.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area tonight and Tuesday and tropical storm conditions are possible
in the watch area later today.

RAINFALL:  The low is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 3 to 6 inches along the northeastern South Carolina, North
Carolina, and southeast Virginia coasts, with possible isolated
maximum amounts of 9 inches.  The heavier rains may result in some
flooding concerns along coastal areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by this disturbance will affect portions of
the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coasts during the
next day or two, creating dangerous surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
