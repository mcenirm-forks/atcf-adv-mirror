DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the disturbance was centered near
latitude 34.4 North, longitude 77.2 West.  The system is moving
toward the northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h), and it is expected to
accelerate toward the northeast and east-northeast during the next
couple of days.  The disturbance is forecast to move near the coast
of North Carolina today and then move away from the coast over the
western Atlantic Ocean tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
The disturbance is not expected to change much in strength today,
and the chances for the system to become a tropical cyclone continue
to decrease.  Regardless of whether or not this system becomes a
tropical cyclone, tropical-storm-force winds and heavy rains are
expected over portions of North Carolina today.  The disturbance is
forecast to strengthen at sea and become a hurricane-force
extratropical low over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean by Wednesday
evening.
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
to the southeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area through this afternoon.

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches with isolated amounts of 5 inches
along the northeast North Carolina and southeast Virginia coasts
into the Delmarva through Wednesday. The heavier rains may result in
some flooding concerns along coastal areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by this disturbance will affect portions of
the North Carolina and Virginia coasts during the next day or so,
creating dangerous surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
