At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the disturbance was centered off the

West.  The system is moving toward the northeast near 20 mph (31
km/h), and it is expected to accelerate further toward the northeast
and east-northeast during the next couple of days.  The disturbance
will continue to move away from the North Carolina coast over the
western Atlantic Ocean tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
The disturbance is forecast to strengthen at sea and become a
hurricane-force extratropical low over the northwestern Atlantic
Ocean by Wednesday evening.  The system is not expected to become a
tropical cyclone.

RAINFALL:  The system is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches from the southeast Virginia coast
into the Delmarva through Wednesday. The heavier rains may result in
some flooding concerns along coastal areas.
