Jose is moving toward the\nwest-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A turn toward the northwest\nwith a decrease in forward speed is forecast to begin overnight and\ncontinue through the weekend.  On the forecast track, the core of\nJose will pass close to or just east of the northern Leeward\nIslands.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuation in intensity, up or down,\ncould occur during the next day or so.  Gradual weakening is\nexpected after that.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140\nmiles (220 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based observations from the\nAir Force Hurricane Hunters is 938 mb (27.70 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are likely within the hurricane warning\narea on Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are also possible within\nthe hurricane watch area on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are\nexpected within the tropical storm warning areas by Saturday\nmorning. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical\nstorm watch area in the northeastern Leeward Islands by Saturday\nmorning and in the watch area in the Virgin Islands by Saturday\nnight.\n\nRAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n3 to 5 inches in the Leeward Islands from Guadeloupe to Anguilla,\nwith isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Jose is also expected to\nproduce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the Virgin\nIslands and Dominica. This rainfall will maintain any ongoing\nflooding and may cause additional life-threatening flooding.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by\n2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in\nthe hurricane warning areas.  Near the coast, the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the\nLeeward Islands.  These swells are expected to continue for a couple\nof days, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Cangialosi\n\nNNNN",
