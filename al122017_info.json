Jose is moving toward the\nwest-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A west-northwest to northwest\nmotion is expected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast\ntrack, the core of Jose will pass close to or just east of the\nnorthern Leeward Islands later today.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 150 mph (240 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the\nSaffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuation in intensity,\nup or down, could occur during the next 24 hours.  Afterward,\ngradual weakening is expected to occur.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140\nmiles (220 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based on observations from\nthe Air Force Hurricane Hunters is 940 mb (27.76 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane\nwarning area today.  Hurricane conditions are also possible within\nthe hurricane watch area today.  Tropical storm conditions are\nexpected within the tropical storm warning areas by this morning.\nTropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch\narea in the northeastern Leeward Islands by this morning and in the\nwatch area in the Virgin Islands by tonight.\n\nRAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n3 to 5 inches in the Leeward Islands from Guadeloupe to Anguilla,\nwith isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Jose is also expected to\nproduce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the Virgin\nIslands and Dominica. This rainfall will maintain any ongoing\nflooding and may cause additional life-threatening flooding.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by\n2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in\nthe hurricane warning areas.  Near the coast, the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the\nLeeward Islands.
