A Tropical Storm Watch may be needed for a portion of the\ncoast of North Carolina on Saturday.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located\nnear latitude 27.9 North, longitude 71.8 West. Jose is moving toward\nthe northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the north with a\nslight decrease in forward speed is expected later today.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Jose could become a little stronger, and is expected to\nremain a hurricane for the next several days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles\n(240 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 983 mb (29.03 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,\nthe northern coasts of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and the southeast\ncoast of the United States, and will spread northward along the\nMid-Atlantic coast of the U.S. during the next few days.  These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.  For more information, please consult products from your\nlocal weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Zelinsky\n\nNNNN",
