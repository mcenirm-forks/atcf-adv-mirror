Jose is moving\ntoward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is\nexpected to continue through Monday night.  A turn toward the\nnorth-northeast is expected on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the\ncenter of Jose is forecast to pass well offshore of the Outer Banks\nof North Carolina on Monday, and pass well east of the Delmarva\npeninsula Monday night and Tuesday.\n\nReports from a NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft\nindicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected during\nthe next day or so, and Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane\nthrough Tuesday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles\n(335 km).\n\nThe lastest minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance\ndata is 972 mb (28.71 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch\narea by Tuesday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,\nand much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause\ndangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several\ndays in these areas.  For more information, please consult products\nfrom your local weather office.\n\nRAINFALL...Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3\nto 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southern Rhode Island, and\nsoutheast Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket\nthrough Wednesday.  Jose is also expected to produce total rain\naccumulations of 1 to 3 inches along the Mid Atlantic coast, and\nfrom southeast New York to coastal Maine.  This rainfall could cause\nisolated flooding.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 200 AM EDT.\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
