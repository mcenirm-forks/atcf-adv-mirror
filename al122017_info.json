Tropical storm watches may be needed for portions of this\narea during the next day or two.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located\nnear latitude 29.2 North, longitude 71.8 West. Jose is moving toward\nthe north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion with a\nslight increase in forward speed is expected through Monday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible over the\nnext couple of days, but Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane\nthrough Monday night.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles\n(295 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,\nthe northern coasts of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and much of the\nU.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause dangerous surf and\nrip current conditions for the next several days in these areas.\nFor more information, please consult products from your local\nweather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
