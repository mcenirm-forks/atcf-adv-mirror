Jose is moving toward the north\nnear 9 mph (15 km/h).  This general motion is expected to continue\nthrough today with a turn to the northeast anticipated tonight.  On\nthe forecast track, the center of Jose is forecast to pass well\noffshore of the Delmarva peninsula later today, pass well to the\neast of the New Jersey coast on Wednesday, and pass offshore of\nsoutheastern Massachusetts by Thursday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Little change in strength is expected today, but Jose should\nbegin to gradually weaken on Wednesday.\n\nJose is a large tropical cyclone.  Hurricane-force winds extend\noutward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the center and tropical-storm-\nforce winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km). A ship\nlocated more than 200 miles southwest of the center of Jose\nrecently reported a sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h), and NOAA\nBuoy 44014, located east of the Virginia-North Carolina border or\nabout 160 miles west of the center, also reported a sustained wind\nof 40 mph (65 km/h).\n\nThe minimum central pressure recently measured by the reconnaissance\naircraft was 973 mb (28.68 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the\nwarning area early Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are\npossible in the watch area beginning tonight.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,\nand much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause\ndangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several\ndays in these areas.  For more information, please consult products\nfrom your local weather office.\n\nRAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n1 to 3 inches over  eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut,\nsouthern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts. Rainfall\namounts of 3 to 5 inches are expected for Martha's Vineyard,\nNantucket and Cape Cod through Wednesday. This rainfall could cause\nisolated flooding.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Stewart\n\nNNNN",
