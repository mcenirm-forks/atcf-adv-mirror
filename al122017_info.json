Jose is moving toward\nthe northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). This motion is expected to\ncontinue tonight with a slowing of forward speed on Monday. Jose\nwill begin turning toward the northeast Monday night, followed by a\nmore eastward motion on Tuesday. On the forecast track, Jose will\nremain well to the east of the Bahamas for the next couple of days.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 120 mph (195\nkm/h) with higher gusts.  Jose is a category 3 hurricane on the\nSaffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional weakening is\nforecast, but Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane during the next\ncouple of days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles\n(260 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the\nnorthern coast of Puerto Rico, and will begin to affect Hispaniola,\nportions of the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the\nnext couple of days. These swells are likely to produce high surf\nand rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local\nweather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster R Ballard\n\nNNNN",
