Jose is moving toward\nthe north near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is expected\nto continue through tonight.  A turn toward the north-northeast is\nexpected on Tuesday night.  On the forecast track, the center of\nJose is forecast to pass well offshore of the Outer Banks of North\nCarolina today, pass well east of the Delmarva peninsula tonight and\nTuesday, and pass well to the east of the New Jersey coast on\nWednesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher\ngusts. Some gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of\ndays, however, Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane through\nTuesday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205\nmiles (335 km).\n\nThe minimum central pressure based on NOAA and Air Force data is 976\nmb (28.82 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch\narea by Tuesday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,\nand much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause\ndangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several\ndays in these areas.  For more information, please consult products\nfrom your local weather office.\n\nRAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n3 to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut,\nsouthern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts, including\nMartha's Vineyard and Nantucket through Wednesday. Jose is also\nexpected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches along\nthe mid-Atlantic coast, and from southeast New York to coastal\nMaine. This rainfall could cause isolated flooding.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Cangialosi\n\nNNNN",
