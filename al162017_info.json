Nate is\nmoving toward the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this\ngeneral track with a marked increase in forward speed is expected\nduring the next day or two. On the forecast track, the center of\nNate will move across the northwestern Caribbean Sea today, and\nreach the eastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula early this evening.\nNate will then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico tonight and\napproach the northern Gulf coast Saturday evening.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.\nStrengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Nate\nis expected to become a hurricane by the time it reaches the\nnorthern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)\nmainly to the east of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through this weekend:\n\nSouthern Honduras and western Nicaragua: 6-10 inches, max 15 inches\nEastern El Salvador and northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches,\nmax 8 inches\nEastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 8 inches\nEastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches\n\nU.S. Central Gulf Coast states: 3 to 6 inches, max 12 inches\n\nHeavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well\naway from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America.\nRainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening\nflash floods and mudslides.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue within\nportions of the warning area in Honduras during the next few\nhours, but gradually subside.  Hurricane conditions are possible\nwithin the hurricane watch area in Mexico by tonight, with tropical\nstorm conditions expected by late this evening.\n\nTropical storm conditions are possible within the watch areas along\nthe U.S. Gulf coast beginning Saturday evening, with hurricane\nconditions possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1\nto 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in\nareas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent\nislands.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the\nnorthwestern Caribbean during the next day or two.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
