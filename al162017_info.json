Preparations to protect life\nand property should be complete.\n\nA Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening\ninundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline in\nthe indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at risk, please\nsee the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,\navailable at hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.\nPersons located within these areas should take all necessary actions\nto protect life and property from rising water and the potential for\nother dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other\ninstructions from local officials.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, including possible\ninland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your\nlocal National Weather Service forecast office.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Nate was located\nby surface observations and NOAA Doppler radar over Biloxi\nMississippi near latitude 30.5 North, longitude 88.9 West. Nate is\nmoving toward the north near 20 mph (31 km/h).  A turn toward the\nnorth-northeast and northeast with an increase in forward speed is\nexpected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast track,\nNate's center will continue to move inland over Mississippi and\nacross the Deep South, Tennessee Valley, and central Appalachian\nMountains through Monday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Nate is expected to weaken quickly as it moves farther\ninland, and it is likely to become a tropical storm later\ntoday. It should degenerate into a remnant low late Monday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from\nthe center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125\nmiles (205 km).\n\nThe minimum central pressure based on surface observations is 984 mb\n(29.06 inches).\n\nA water level of 4.8 ft Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) was recently\nreported by a National Ocean Service gauge at Shell Beach,\nLouisiana.  The gauge at Bay Waveland Yacht Club, Mississippi,\nrecently reported a water level of 5.5 ft MHHW.\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected to\ncontinue in the hurricane warning area for the next several hours.\nTropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning\narea through this morning.\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide\nwill cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising\nwaters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to\nreach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at\nthe time of high tide...\n\nMouth of the Pearl River to the Mississippi/Alabama border...7 to 11\nft\nMississippi/Alabama border to the Alabama/Florida border, including\nMobile Bay...6 to 9 ft\nNorth of Pointe a la Hache to the mouth of the Pearl River...4\nto 6 ft\nAlabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line...4 to 6\nft\nMorgan City, Louisiana to Pointe a la Hache...1 to 3 ft\nOkaloosa/Walton County Line to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 3 ft\nIndian Pass to Crystal River, Florida...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe east of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related\nflooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal\ncycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local\nNational Weather Service forecast office.\n\nRAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Monday:\n\nWestern Cuba: additional 1 to 2 inches.\n\nEast of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the\nDeep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians:\n3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches.\n\nAcross the Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians:\n2 to 5 inches, max 7 inches.\n\nTORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible across parts of Alabama,\nthe western Florida Panhandle, western Georgia, and southern\nMississippi today.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the\nGulf of Mexico during the next day or so.  These swells are likely\nto cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please\nconsult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
