Nate is moving toward the northwest near 9 mph\n(15 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northwest at a faster forward\nspeed is expected this afternoon or tonight, with that motion\ncontinuing through Friday night.  On the forecast track, the center\nof Nate should move across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern\nHonduras this afternoon and then over the northwestern Caribbean Sea\ntonight and Friday.  The center is expected to approach the coast of\nthe Yucatan Peninsula late Friday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher\ngusts. Little change in strength is expected today while the center\nis over land.  Strengthening is likely once the center moves over\nthe northwestern Caribbean Sea tonight and Friday.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (80 km)\nmainly over water to the east of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Friday night:\n\nNicaragua...15 to 20 inches, isolated 30 inches\nCosta Rica and Panama...5 to 10 inches, isolated 20 inches\nHonduras and Eastern portions of the Yucatan Peninsula...4 to 8\ninches, isolated 12 inches\nBelize...2 to 5 inches, isolated 8 inches\n\nHeavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well\naway from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America.\nRainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening\nflash floods and mudslides.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the\nwarning area in Nicaragua and Honduras today and tonight.  Hurricane\nconditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Mexico\nFriday night, with tropical storm conditions expected by late\nFriday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Nate are affecting portions of the coast\nof Nicaragua, and will begin to affect other land areas around the\nnorthwestern Caribbean during the next day or two.
