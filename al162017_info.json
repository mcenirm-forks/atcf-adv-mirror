Nate is moving\ntoward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A turn toward the\nnorth-northwest is expected today, with Nate accelerating along that\nheading through Saturday.  On the forecast track, the center of Nate\nwill move over the Gulf of Honduras and across the northwestern\nCaribbean Sea today, and reach the eastern coast of the Yucatan\npeninsula Friday evening. Nate will then move into the southern Gulf\nof Mexico Friday night and approach the northern Gulf coast Saturday\nevening.\n\nData from the reconnaissance plane and a NOAA buoy indicate that the\nmaximum sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h)\nwith higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple\nof days, and Nate is expected to become a hurricane by the time it\nreaches the central Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)\nmainly to the east of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure from a reconnaissance plane\ndata is 999 mb (29.50 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through this weekend:\n\nSouthern Honduras and western Nicaragua: 6-10 inches, max 15 inches\nEastern El Salvador and northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches,\nmax 8 inches\nEastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 8 inches\nEastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches\n\nU.S. Central Gulf Coast states: 3 to 6 inches, max 12 inches\n\nHeavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well\naway from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America.\nRainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening\nflash floods and mudslides.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within portions of the\nwarning area in Honduras during the next few hours.  Hurricane\nconditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in Mexico\nby Friday evening, with tropical storm conditions expected by\nlate Friday.\n\nTropical storm conditions are possible within the watch areas along\nthe U.S. Gulf coast beginning Saturday evening, with hurricane\nconditions possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1\nto 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in\nareas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent\nislands.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the\nnorthwestern Caribbean during the next day or two.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
