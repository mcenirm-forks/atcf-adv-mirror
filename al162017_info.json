The\ndepression is moving toward the north-northeast near 24 mph (39\nkm/h).  A turn toward the northeast with an increase in forward\nspeed is expected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast\ntrack, Nate's center will continue to move inland across the Deep\nSouth, Tennessee Valley, and central Appalachian Mountains through\nMonday.\n\nSurface observations indicate that the maximum sustained winds have\ndecreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change\nin strength is predicted during the next couple of days, but Nate\nis forecast to become post-tropical on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical-storm-force wind gusts are expected over the\nthe Florida Panhandle, and portions of Alabama and Georgia through\nthis afternoon.\n\nSTORM SURGE: Water levels remain elevated along portions of the\nnorthern Gulf coast, but should gradually subside this afternoon.\n\nRAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Monday:\n\nEast of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the\nDeep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians:\n3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches.\n\nAcross the Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians:\n2 to 5 inches, max 7 inches.\n\nTORNADOES:  A couple tornadoes will be possible today, mainly from\nthe Florida Panhandle and eastern Alabama across western and\nnorthern Georgia into the western Carolinas.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the\nGulf of Mexico through this evening.  These swells are likely\nto cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
