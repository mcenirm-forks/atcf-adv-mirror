For storm information specific to your area outside the\nUnited States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was\nlocated near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 85.3 West.  Nate is\nmoving toward the north-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h) and this\nmotion is expected to continue through Saturday, with a turn toward\nthe north and northeast expected Saturday night and Sunday.  On the\nforecast track, the center of Nate will move across the northwestern\nCaribbean Sea this afternoon and move near or over the northeastern\ncoast of the Yucatan peninsula this evening.  Nate will then move\ninto the southern Gulf of Mexico tonight, approach the northern Gulf\ncoast Saturday, and then move near or over the northern Gulf coast\nSaturday night or Sunday.\n\nReports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft\nindicate that maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next couple\nof days, and Nate is expected to become a hurricane by the time it\nreaches the northern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)\nmainly to the east of the center.  NOAA buoy 42056, located to the\nnorth of the center, recently reported a 1-minute average wind of\n38 mph (61 km/h) and a wind gust of 49 mph (79 km/h).\n\nThe minimum central pressure recently reported by the Hurricane\nHunter is 996 mb (29.42 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nRAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through this weekend:\n\nSouthern Honduras and western Nicaragua: 6-10 inches, max 15 inches\nEastern El Salvador and northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches,\nmax 8 inches\nEastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 8 inches\nEastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches\n\nU.S. Central Gulf Coast states, eastern Tennessee Valley and\nsouthern Appalachians: 3 to 6 inches, max 12 inches\n\nHeavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well\naway from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America.\nRainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening\nflash floods and mudslides.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch\narea in Mexico by tonight, with tropical storm conditions expected\nby this evening.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the\nwarning area in Cuba by tonight, and are possible in the watch area\nin Cuba tonight.\n\nAlong the northern Gulf Coast, hurricane conditions are expected in\nthe hurricane warning area Saturday night, with tropical storm\nconditions expected by late Saturday. Tropical storm conditions are\nexpected in the tropical storm warning area by Saturday night.\nHurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area\nSaturday night, and tropical storm conditions are possible in the\ntropical storm watch area Saturday night and Sunday.\n\nSTORM SURGE: In the United States, the combination of a dangerous\nstorm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the\ncoast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the\nshoreline.  The water is expected to reach the following heights\nabove ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nMorgan City, Louisiana to the Alabama/Florida border...4 to 7 ft\nAlabama/Florida border to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 4 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe east of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related\nflooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal\ncycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local\nNational Weather Service forecast office.\n\nIn Mexico, a storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1\nto 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in\nareas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent\nislands.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the\nnorthwestern Caribbean during the next day or so.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Beven\n\nNNNN",
