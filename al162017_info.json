Nate is moving toward\nthe north-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general fast\nmotion is expected to continue through tonight. A turn toward the\nnorth is forecast on Sunday morning, followed by a turn toward the\nnorth-northeast thereafter.  On the forecast track, the center of\nNate will move across the Gulf of Mexico today and will make\nlandfall along the central U.S. Gulf coast tonight.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some strengthening is possible before Nate makes landfall\nalong the northern Gulf coast. Another reconnaissance plane will\ninvestigate Nate soon.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles\n(205 km). Cabo San Antonio in the western tip of Cuba reported\ngusts to 53 mph (85 km/h) a few hours ago.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Along the northern Gulf Coast, hurricane conditions are\nexpected in the hurricane warning area tonight, with tropical storm\nconditions expected to begin earlier. Tropical storm conditions are\nexpected in the tropical storm warning area tonight. Hurricane\nconditions are possible in the hurricane watch area tonight and\ntropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch\narea tonight and Sunday.\n\nSTORM SURGE: In the United States, the combination of a dangerous\nstorm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the\ncoast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the\nshoreline.  The water is expected to reach the following heights\nabove ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nMorgan City, Louisiana to the mouth of the Mississippi River...4 to\n6 ft\nMouth of the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida border...5 to\n9 ft\nAlabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line...4 to 6\nft\nOkaloosa/Walton County Line to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 4 ft\nIndian Pass to Crystal River, Florida...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe east of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related\nflooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal\ncycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local\nNational Weather Service forecast office.\n\nRAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Monday:\n\nEastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches.\nEastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches.\n\nEast of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the\nDeep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians:\n3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches.\n\nAcross the Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians:\n2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches.\n\nTORNADOES:  Isolated tornadoes will be possible beginning later\ntoday over parts of the central Gulf Coast region.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the\nwestern Gulf of Mexico during the next day or so.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.\nNext complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
