Maria is\nmoving toward the east near 13 mph (20 km/h), and the storm is\nexpected to accelerate eastward through tonight.  A turn back toward\nthe east-northeast with an additional increase in forward speed is\nexpected on Friday.  On the forecast track, Maria will continue to\nmove away from the U.S. east coast and pass well to the south of\nAtlantic Canada during the next couple of days.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some slight weakening is possible during the next 48 hours.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km)\nfrom the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the east\ncoast of the United States, Atlantic Canada, and Bermuda.  These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office\nfor more information.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Stewart\n\nNNNN",
