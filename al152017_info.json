Tropical storm or hurricane watches may be\nneeded for a portion of the coast later today.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Maria was located\nnear latitude 28.7 North, longitude 72.9 West.  Maria is moving\ntoward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with\nsome decrease in forward speed is expected through Monday night.  On\nthe forecast track, the core of Maria will be moving well east of\nthe southeast coast of the United States during the day or so.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible during the next\n24 hours, but gradual weakening is expected by Monday night or\nTuesday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles\n(390 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 947 mb (27.97 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are increasing along portions of\nthe southeastern United States coast and Bermuda and will be\nincreasing along the Mid-Atlantic coast later today.  Swells also\ncontinue to affect Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the northern\ncoast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather\noffice for more information.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
