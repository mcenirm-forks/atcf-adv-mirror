S.\nVirgin Islands should monitor the progress of this system.\nAdditional Tropical Storm or Hurricane Watches and Warnings will\nlikely be issued early Sunday.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor\nproducts issued by your national meteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Maria was\nlocated near latitude 12.5 North, longitude 53.7 West. Maria is\nmoving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A turn toward the\nwest-northwest and a slower forward speed are expected during next\ncouple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Maria will be\nnear the Leeward Islands Monday or Monday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.\nStrengthening is expected during the next 48 hours, and Maria is\nforecast to be a hurricane when it approaches the Leeward Islands.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)\nfrom the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch\narea by Monday night or Tuesday, with tropical storm conditions\npossible on Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the\ntropical storm watch area on Monday.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet\nabove normal tide levels within the hurricane watch area.\n\nRAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 6\nto 12 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches across the\ncentral and southern Leeward Islands through Tuesday night. Maria is\nalso expected to produce total rain accumulations of 2 to 4 inches\nwith isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches in the northern Leeward\nIslands through Tuesday night. This rainfall could cause\nlife-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are expected to begin affecting the\nLesser Antilles by Sunday night.  These swells are likely to cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Beven\n\nNNNN",
