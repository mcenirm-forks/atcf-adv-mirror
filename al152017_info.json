Maria is moving\ntoward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion\nwith a decrease in forward speed is expected through Thursday night.\nA turn toward the north-northwest is forecast on Friday.  On the\nforecast track, the center of Maria will continue to move away from\nthe northwestern coast of Puerto Rico this evening.  The center will\nthen pass offshore of the northeastern coast of the Dominican\nRepublic tonight and Thursday and then move near the Turks and\nCaicos Islands and southeastern Bahamas Thursday night and Friday.\n\nData from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate\nthat maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next day or two,\nand Maria could regain major hurricane status by Thursday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the\ncenter, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150\nmiles (240 km).\n\nThe minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force\naircraft is 957 mb (28.26 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are still occurring\nover portions of Puerto Rico.  Tropical storm conditions are\nspreading across the warning areas in the Dominican Republic, and\nhurricane conditions should start in the hurricane warning area\ntonight.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the\nTurks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas on Thursday,\nwith hurricane conditions starting Thursday night.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nPuerto Rico...3 to 5 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore wind over western portions of Puerto Rico, where the surge\nwill be accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related\nflooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal\ncycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local\nNational Weather Service forecast office.\n\nA dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves\nwill raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide\nlevels in the hurricane warning area in the Dominican Republic, and\n1 to 3 ft elsewhere along the northern coasts of the Dominican\nRepublic and Haiti.\n\nA dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves\nwill raise water levels by as much as 9 to 12 feet above normal\ntide levels within the hurricane warning area of the southeastern\nBahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nRAINFALL:  Maria is expected to produce the following rainfall\ntotals through Friday:\n\nPuerto Rico...20 to 25 inches, isolated 35 inches\nU.S. and British Virgin Islands...additional 3 to 5 inches\nNorthern and eastern Dominican Republic, Turks and Caicos and\nsoutheast Bahamas...8 to 16 inches, isolated 20 inches\nNorthern Haiti...2 to 4 inches\n\nRainfall on these islands will cause life-threatening flash floods\nand mudslides\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting the Leeward Islands,\nPuerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  These swells will begin\naffecting the northern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos\nIslands, and the Southeastern Bahamas during the next day or two.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather\noffice.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
