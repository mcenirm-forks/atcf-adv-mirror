Maria is moving\ntoward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general\nmotion is expected to continue through Wednesday.  On the forecast\ntrack, the core of Maria will move near Dominica and the adjacent\nLeeward Islands during the next few hours, over the extreme\nnortheastern Caribbean Sea the remainder of tonight and Tuesday, and\napproach Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands Tuesday night and\nWednesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 160 mph (260 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Maria is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some additional strengthening is possible\ntonight, but some fluctuations in intensity are likely during the\nnext day or two.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles\n(205 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based on Air Force Hurricane\nHunter data is 925 mb (27.32 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions should be spreading across Dominica,\nGuadeloupe, and Martinique during the next few hours, with tropical\nstorm conditions already occurring over portions of the Leeward\nIslands.  Hurricane conditions should spread through the remainder\nof the hurricane warning area tonight through Wednesday.  Hurricane\nconditions are possible within the hurricane watch area Tuesday\nthrough Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions possible\ntonight.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical\nstorm watch area in St. Vincent and the Grenadines through tonight,\nand are possible in the tropical storm watch area in the Dominican\nRepublic on Wednesday.\n\nWind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains\nare often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface\nwinds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations\ncould be even greater.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet\nabove normal tide levels in the hurricane warning area near where\nthe center of Maria moves across the Leeward Islands and the\nBritish Virgin Islands.\n\nThe combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause\nnormally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters\nmoving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to reach\nthe following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the\ntime of high tide...\n\nPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands...6 to 9 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe north and east of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related\nflooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal\ncycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local\nNational Weather Service forecast office.\n\nRAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Thursday:\n\nCentral and southern Leeward Islands...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20\ninches.\nU.S. and British Virgin Islands...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20\ninches.\nPuerto Rico...12 to 18 inches, isolated 25 inches.\nNorthern Leeward Islands from Barbuda to Anguilla...4 to 8 inches,\nisolated 10 inches.\nWindward Islands and Barbados...2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.\nEastern Dominican Republic...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches.\n\nRainfall on all of these islands could cause life-threatening flash\nfloods and mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting the Lesser Antilles.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions.  Please consult products from your local\nweather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
