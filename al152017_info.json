Maria is moving\ntoward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this general\nmotion is expected to continue through Wednesday night.  On the\nforecast track, the eye of Maria will move near or over St. Croix\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands tonight, cross Puerto Rico on Wednesday,\nand then pass just north of the coast of the Dominican Republic\nWednesday night and Thursday.\n\nReports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft\nindicate that maximum sustained winds are near 175 mph (280 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Maria is a potentially catastrophic category\n5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some\nfluctuations in intensity are likely during the next day or so, but\nMaria is forecast to remain an extremely dangerous category 4 or 5\nhurricane as it moves near or over the Virgin Islands and Puerto\nRico.  Slow weakening is expected after the hurricane emerges over\nthe Atlantic north of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140\nmiles (220 km).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane\nHunter aircraft is 909 mb (26.84 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions will continue in\nportions of the warning area in the Leeward Islands this evening,\nand spread into the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight and\nWednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are spreading over the Virgin\nIslands at this time.  Tropical storm conditions should begin\nspreading over Puerto Rico within the next few hours.  Hurricane\nconditions are expected within the hurricane warning area in the\nDominican Republic late Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions\nexpected by early Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected\nin the tropical storm warning areas in the Dominican Republic on\nWednesday. Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible on\nThursday in the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern\nBahamas.\n\nWind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains\nand on high-rise buildings could be much stronger than the near-\nsurface winds indicated in this advisory.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 7 to 11\nfeet above normal tide levels in the hurricane warning area near\nwhere the center of Maria moves across the Leeward Islands and the\nBritish Virgin Islands.\n\nA dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves\nwill raise water levels by as much as 4 to 6 feet above normal tide\nlevels in the hurricane warning area in the Dominican Republic, and\n1 to 3 ft elsewhere along the northern coasts of the Dominican\nRepublic and Haiti.\n\nThe combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause\nnormally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters\nmoving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to reach\nthe following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the\ntime of high tide...\n\nPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands...6 to 9 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe north and east of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related\nflooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal\ncycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local\nNational Weather Service forecast office.\n\nRAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Thursday:\n\nCentral and southern Leeward Islands...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20\ninches.\nU.S. and British Virgin Islands...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20\ninches.\nPuerto Rico...12 to 18 inches, isolated 25 inches.\nNorthern Leeward Islands from Barbuda to Anguilla...4 to 8 inches,\nisolated 10 inches.\nWindward Islands and Barbados...2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.\nEastern Dominican Republic...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches.\n\nRainfall on all of these islands will cause life-threatening flash\nfloods and mudslides.\n\nTORNADOES: Several tornadoes are possible over Puerto Rico and the\nU. S. Virgin Islands tonight and Wednesday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting the Leeward Islands,\nPuerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  These swells are likely to\ncause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please\nconsult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
