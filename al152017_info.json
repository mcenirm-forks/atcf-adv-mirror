Maria is moving\ntoward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion with\nsome decrease in forward speed is expected through tonight.  A turn\ntoward the north-northeast is expected on Wednesday.  On the\nforecast track, the center of Maria will pass east of the coast of\nNorth Carolina during the next couple of days.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher\ngusts.   Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of\ndays, and Maria is forecast to become a tropical storm within the\nnext day or so.\n\nMaria is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up\nto 105 miles (165 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds\nextend outward up to 240 miles (390 km). NOAA buoy 41025 located\nabout 15 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras recently reported a\nsustained wind of 39 mph (63 km/h) with a wind gust to 49 mph (80\nkm/h).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance\naircraft data is 971 mb (28.68 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning\narea beginning this afternoon.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nCape Lookout to Duck including the sound side of the Outer\nBanks...2 to 4 ft\n\nSurge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge\nand the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For\ninformation specific to your area, please see products issued by\nyour local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nRAINFALL:  Maria is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 1 to 2 inches over the Outer Banks of North Carolina through\nWednesday.\n\nSURF:  Large swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the\neast coast of the United States.  These swells are also affecting\nBermuda, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office\nfor more information.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 200 PM EDT.\nNext complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
