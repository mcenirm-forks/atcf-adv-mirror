For storm information specific to your area\noutside the United States, please monitor products issued by your\nnational meteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Maria was located\nnear latitude 16.0 North, longitude 62.3 West.  Maria is moving\ntoward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general\nmotion is expected to continue through Wednesday.  On the forecast\ntrack, the eye of Maria will move over the northeastern Caribbean\nSea today, and approach the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight\nand Wednesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Maria is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely\nduring the next day or two, but Maria is forecast to remain an\nextremely dangerous category 4 or 5 hurricane while it approaches\nthe Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.  An Air Force Hurricane Hunter\naircraft is currently investigating Maria.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles\n(205 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 934 mb (27.58 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions will continue to spread throughout\nportions of the hurricane warning area in the Leeward Islands this\nmorning.  Hurricane conditions should spread through the remainder\nof the Hurricane Warning area later today and Wednesday.  Hurricane\nconditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area in the\nDominican Republic late Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions\npossible by early Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible\nin the Tropical Storm Watch area in St. Vincent and the Grenadines\nthis morning, and are possible in the Tropical Storm Watch area in\nthe Dominican Republic on Wednesday.\n\nWind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains\ncould be much stronger than the near-surface winds indicated in this\nadvisory.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 7 to 11\nfeet above normal tide levels in the hurricane warning area near\nwhere the center of Maria moves across the Leeward Islands and the\nBritish Virgin Islands.\n\nThe combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause\nnormally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters\nmoving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to reach\nthe following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the\ntime of high tide...\n\nPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands...6 to 9 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\nthe north and east of the landfall location, where the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related\nflooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal\ncycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local\nNational Weather Service forecast office.\n\nRAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Thursday:\n\nCentral and southern Leeward Islands...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20\ninches.\nU.S. and British Virgin Islands...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20\ninches.\nPuerto Rico...12 to 18 inches, isolated 25 inches.\nNorthern Leeward Islands from Barbuda to Anguilla...4 to 8 inches,\nisolated 10 inches.\nWindward Islands and Barbados...2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.\nEastern Dominican Republic...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches.\n\nRainfall on all of these islands will cause life-threatening flash\nfloods and mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting the Lesser Antilles.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions.  Please consult products from your local\nweather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
