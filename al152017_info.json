Maria is moving\ntoward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion with\nsome decrease in forward speed is expected through Tuesday.  On the\nforecast track, the core of Maria will move well east of the\nsoutheast coast of the United States during the next day or so.\n\nReports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft\nindicate that maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph\n(135 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional slow weakening is forecast\nduring the next 48 hours.\n\nMaria is a large hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward\nup to 60 miles (95 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force\nwinds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).\n\nThe minimum central pressure recently reported by the Hurricane\nHunter aircraft is 954 mb (28.17 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area\nbeginning Tuesday.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nCape Lookout to Duck including the sound side of the Outer\nBanks...2 to 4 ft\n\nSurge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge\nand the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For\ninformation specific to your area, please see products issued by\nyour local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are increasing along portions of\nthe southeastern United States coast and Bermuda and will be\nincreasing along the Mid-Atlantic coast tonight and Monday.  Swells\nalso continue to affect Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the\nnorthern coast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the\nBahamas.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and\nrip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local\nweather office for more information.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Beven\n\nNNNN",
