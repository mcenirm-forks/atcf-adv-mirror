Tropical storm or hurricane watches may be\nneeded for a portion of the coast on Sunday.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the distinct eye of Hurricane Maria was\nlocated near latitude 27.0 North, longitude 72.5 West. Maria is\nmoving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general\nmotion is expected to continue through Monday. On the forecast\ntrack, the core of Maria will be moving well east of the United\nStates southeast coast during the next 2 days.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Maria is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely\nduring the next day or so.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles\n(390 km). NOAA buoy 41047 located north of Maria recently reported a\nsustained wind of 54 mph (86 km/h) with a gust of 75 mph (122 km/h).\n\nThe minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane\nHunter plane was 942 mb (27.82 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are increasing along portions of\nthe southeastern United States coast and Bermuda and will be\nincreasing along the Mid-Atlantic coast on Sunday.  Swells also\ncontinue to affect Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the northern\ncoast of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather\noffice for more information.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
