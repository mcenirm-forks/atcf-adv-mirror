Maria is moving\ntoward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this motion\nwith a decrease in forward speed is expected through Tuesday night.\nOn the forecast track, the center of Maria will move across the\nLeeward Islands late Monday and Monday night and then over the\nextreme northeastern Caribbean Sea Tuesday and Tuesday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next\n48 hours, and Maria is expected to become a major hurricane as it\nmoves through the Leeward Islands.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles\n(165 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are first expected within portions of\nthe Leeward Islands by late Monday, with tropical storm conditions\nbeginning during the day on Monday.  Hurricane conditions are\npossible within the hurricane watch area by Tuesday, with tropical\nstorm conditions possible Monday night.  Tropical storm conditions\nare possible in the tropical storm watch area later tonight through\nMonday night.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves will raise water levels by as much as 5 to 7 feet\nabove normal tide levels near where the center of Maria moves\nacross the Leeward Islands.\n\nRAINFALL: Maria is expected to produce total rain accumulations of\n6 to 12 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches across the\ncentral and southern Leeward Islands, including Puerto Rico and the\nU.S. and British Virgin Islands, through Wednesday night.  Maria is\nalso expected to produce total rain accumulations of 2 to 4 inches\nwith isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches over the remaining\nnorthern Leeward Islands from Barbuda to Anguilla, as well as the\nWindward Islands and Barbados.  Rainfall on all of these islands\ncould cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting the Lesser Antilles.\nThese swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions.  Please consult products from your local\nweather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 200 AM AST.\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Beven\n\nNNNN",
