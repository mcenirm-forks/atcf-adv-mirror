Maria is moving\ntoward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this general motion with\nsome decrease in forward speed is expected through Tuesday night. On\nthe forecast track, the center of Maria will move well east of the\nsoutheast coast of the United States during the next day or so.\n\nReports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft\nindicate that maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h)\nwith higher gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next\ncouple of days and Maria is forecast to become a tropical storm\nTuesday night.\n\nMaria is a large hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up\nto 90 miles (150 km) primarily to the east of center and tropical-\nstorm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure reported by reconnaissance\naircraft is 963 mb (28.44 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning\narea beginning Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible\nwithin the watch area beginning Tuesday.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nCape Lookout to Duck including the sound side of the Outer\nBanks...2 to 4 ft\n\nSurge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge\nand the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For\ninformation specific to your area, please see products issued by\nyour local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nRAINFALL:  Maria is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations\nof 1 to 2 inches over the Outer Banks of North Carolina through\nWednesday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Maria are affecting portions of the coast\nof the southeastern United States and Bermuda and will be increasing\nalong the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts today.\nSwells also continue to affect Puerto Rico, the northern coast of\nHispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the Bahamas.  These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office\nfor more information.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 200 PM EDT.\nNext complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
