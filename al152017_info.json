Maria is\nmoving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A turn toward the\nnorth-northeast is expected later today, followed by an\nacceleration toward the east-northeast on Thursday.  On the\nforecast track, Maria's center will begin to turn slowly away from\nthe coast of North Carolina later today and tonight.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple\nof days.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)\nfrom the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning\narea through today.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nCape Lookout to Duck including the sound side of the Outer\nBanks...2 to 4 ft\n\nSurge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge\nand the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For\ninformation specific to your area, please see products issued by\nyour local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nRAINFALL:  Maria is expected to produce additional rain\naccumulations of less than 1 inch over the Outer Banks of North\nCarolina and far southeast Virginia through Wednesday night.\n\nSURF:  Large swells generated by Maria are affecting much of the\neast coast of the United States, Atlantic Canada, Bermuda, the\nBahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  These swells are likely\nto cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please\nconsult products from your local weather office for more\ninformation.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
