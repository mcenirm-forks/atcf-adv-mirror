during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.

Interests elsewhere in the southeastern United States should monitor
the progress of Irma.

For storm information specific to your area in the United States,
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office. For storm information specific to your area outside the
United States, please monitor products issued by your national
meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Irma was located
near latitude 25.6 North, longitude 81.8 West.  Irma is moving
toward the north near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a north-northwestward
motion with a further increase in forward speed is expected later
today, with that motion continuing through Monday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Irma should move near or over the southwest
and west coast of the Florida Peninsula later today through
tonight.  Irma should then move inland over northern Florida and
southwestern Georgia Monday afternoon.

Maximum sustained winds are near 120 mph (195 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Irma is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  While weakening is forecast, Irma is expected
to remain a powerful hurricane while it moves near or along the west
coast of Florida.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220
miles (350 km).  A 62 mph (100 km/h) sustained wind and 99 mph (158
km/h) gust was recently reported at the Federal Aviation
Administration station at Miami International Airport.  An 81 mph
(130 km/h) wind gust was recently reported at the Miami Weather
Forecast Office/National Hurricane Center.

The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 936 mb (27.64 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Cape Sable to Captiva...10 to 15 ft
Captiva to Ana Maria Island...6 to 10 ft
Card Sound Bridge through Cape Sable, including the Florida Keys...
5 to 10 ft
Ana Maria Island to Clearwater Beach, including Tampa Bay...
5 to 8 ft
North Miami Beach to Card Sound Bridge, including Biscayne Bay...
3 to 5 ft
South Santee River to Fernandina Beach...4 to 6 ft
Clearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River...4 to 6 ft
Fernandina Beach to Jupiter Inlet...2 to 4 ft
North of North Miami Beach to Jupiter Inlet...1 to 2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and large breaking
waves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS by the
following amounts within the hurricane warning area near and to the
north of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are continuing across portions of the
Florida Keys and southern Florida.  Winds affecting the upper floors
of high-rise buildings will be significantly stronger than those
near ground level.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are
expected to spread northward across the remainder of the warning
areas through Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected to
continue in portions of the warning area in the Northwestern Bahamas
today.

RAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations through Wednesday:

Western Cuba...Additional 1 to 3 inches, isolated 5 inches.
Western Bahamas...Additional 2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.
The Florida Keys...15 to 20 inches, isolated 25 inches.
Western Florida peninsula...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20 inches.
Eastern Florida peninsula and southeast Georgia...8 to 12 inches,
isolated 16 inches.
The rest of Georgia, the eastern Florida Panhandle, southern and
western
South Carolina, and western North Carolina...3 to 8 inches, isolated
12 inches.
Eastern Alabama and southern Tennessee...2 to 5 inches.

In all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods
and, in some areas, mudslides.

TORNADOES:  Tornadoes are possible through tonight, mainly across
southern, central, and eastern portions of the Florida Peninsula.

THE EYE: Do not venture outside when the calm eye of the hurricane
passes over, as dangerous winds will return very quickly when the
eye moves away.

SURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeast coast of
the United States.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
