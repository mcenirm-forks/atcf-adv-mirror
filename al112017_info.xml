Interests in the remainder of the Leeward Islands, the British and

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Irma was located
near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 51.0 West.  Irma is moving
toward the west-southwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A
west-southwestward to westward motion is expected through Monday
night. On the forecast track, the center of Irma is expected to
approach the northern Leeward Islands late Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Irma is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is forecast during the
next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a minimum central
pressure of 961 mb (28.38 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
Tuesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by late
Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Irma will begin affecting the northern
Leeward Islands on Monday.  These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
