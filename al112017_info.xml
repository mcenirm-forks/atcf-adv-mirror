* North Miami Beach southward around the Florida peninsula to the
Ochlockonee River
* Florida Keys
* Tampa Bay

A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,
during the next 36 hours in the indicated locations. For a
depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at
hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons
located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.

Interests elsewhere in the southeastern United States should monitor
the progress of Irma.

For storm information specific to your area in the United States,
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office. For storm information specific to your area outside the
United States, please monitor products issued by your national
meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Irma was located
by NOAA Doppler radar near latitude 27.5 North, longitude 81.9 West.
Irma is moving toward the north near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn
toward the north-northwest and then northwest at a faster forward
speed is expected during the next day or so.  On the forecast track,
the center of Irma will continue to move over the western Florida
peninsula through Monday morning and then into the southeastern
United States late Monday and Tuesday.

Doppler radar data indicate that maximum sustained winds have
decreased to near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher gusts.  Additional
weakening is forecast, and Irma is expected to become a tropical
storm over far northern Florida or southern Georgia on Monday.

Irma has a very large wind field. Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from the center, and tropical-storm-
force winds extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Cape Sable to Captiva...4 to 6 ft
Captiva to Anna Maria Island...3 to 5 ft
North Miami Beach to Cape Sable, including the Florida Keys...3 to 5
ft
Anna Maria Island to Clearwater Beach, including Tampa Bay...2 to 4
ft
South Santee River to Fernandina Beach...4 to 6 ft
Clearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River...4 to 6 ft
Fernandina Beach to Jupiter Inlet...3 to 5 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are continuing across portions of the
central Florida peninsula.  Winds affecting the upper floors of
high-rise buildings will be significantly stronger than those near
ground level.  Tropical storm conditions will continue across
portions of southern Florida and the Florida Keys through Monday
morning.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are expected
to spread northward across the remainder of the warning areas
through Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions
of the warning area in the Northwestern Bahamas overnight.

RAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations through Wednesday:

Western Bahamas...Additional 2 to 4 inches.

The Florida Keys...Additional 1 inch possible with storm total
amounts from 15 to 20 inches, isolated 25 inches.

Western Florida peninsula...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20 inches.

Eastern Florida peninsula and southeast Georgia...8 to 12 inches,
isolated 16 inches.

The rest of Georgia, the eastern Florida Panhandle, southern and
western South Carolina, and western North Carolina...3 to 8 inches,
isolated 12 inches.

Southern Tennessee, northern Mississippi and much of Alabama...2 to
5 inches.

In all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible across northeast Florida
and southeast portions of Georgia and South Carolina through Monday
night.

SURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeast coast of
the United States.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
