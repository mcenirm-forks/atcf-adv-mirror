depiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather
Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at

located within these areas should take all necessary actions to
protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.

Interests elsewhere in the southeastern United States should monitor
the progress of Irma.

For storm information specific to your area in the United
States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please
monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service
forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside
the United States, please monitor products issued by your national
meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Irma was located
near latitude 25.0 North, longitude 81.5 West. Irma is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h, and a north-northwestward motion with
an increase in forward speed is expected later today, with that
motion continuing through Monday.  On the forecast track, the eye of
Irma should move over the Lower Florida Keys shortly, and then move
near or over the west coast of the Florida Peninsula later today
through tonight.  Irma should then move inland over northern Florida
and southwestern Georgia Monday afternoon.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Irma is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  While weakening is forecast, Irma is expected
to remain a powerful hurricane while it moves near or along the west
coast of Florida.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220
miles (350 km).  A 120 mph (193 km/h) gust was recently reported at
the National Key Deer Refuge in Big Pine Key.  A sustained wind of
62 mph (100 km/h) with a gust of 94 mph (151 km/h) was reported at
the Federal Aviation Administration station at Miami International
Airport.  A pressure of 940 mb (27.75 inches) was measured in the
calm of the eye on Upper Sugarloaf Key.

The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 933 mb (27.55 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Cape Sable to Captiva...10 to 15 ft
Captiva to Ana Maria Island...6 to 10 ft
Card Sound Bridge through Cape Sable, including the Florida Keys...
5 to 10 ft
Ana Maria Island to Clearwater Beach, including Tampa Bay...
5 to 8 ft
North Miami Beach to Card Sound Bridge, including Biscayne Bay...
3 to 5 ft
South Santee River to Fernandina Beach...4 to 6 ft
Clearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River...4 to 6 ft
Fernandina Beach to Jupiter Inlet...2 to 4 ft
North of North Miami Beach to Jupiter Inlet...1 to 2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of
onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative
timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and large breaking
waves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS by the
following amounts within the hurricane warning area near and to the
north of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

Water levels along the north coast of Cuba will gradually subside
today.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to continue within the
hurricane warning area along the north coast of Cuba through
this morning.  Hurricane conditions are continuing across portions
of the Florida Keys and southern Florida.  Winds affecting the upper
floors of high-rise buildings will be significantly stronger than
those near ground level.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions
are expected to spread northward across the remainder of the warning
areas through Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the
watch area in the Northwestern Bahamas today.

RAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations through Wednesday:

Western Cuba...Additional 1 to 3 inches, isolated 5 inches.
Western Bahamas...Additional 2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.
The Florida Keys...15 to 20 inches, isolated 25 inches.
Western Florida peninsula...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20 inches.
Eastern Florida peninsula and southeast Georgia...8 to 12 inches,
isolated 16 inches.
The rest of Georgia, the eastern Florida Panhandle, southern and
western
South Carolina, and western North Carolina...3 to 8 inches, isolated
12 inches.
Eastern Alabama and southern Tennessee...2 to 5 inches.

In all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods
and, in some areas, mudslides.

TORNADOES:  Tornadoes are possible through tonight, mainly across
southern, central, and eastern portions of the Florida Peninsula.

THE EYE: Do not venture outside when the calm eye of the hurricane
passes over, as dangerous winds will return very quickly when the
eye moves away.

SURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeast coast of
the United States.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
