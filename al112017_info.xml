DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Irma was located by a
NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 17.4 North, longitude
50.3 West.  Irma is moving toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A
westward to west-southwestward motion with some reduction in forward
speed is expected through Monday night.  On the forecast track, the
center of Irma is expected to approach the northern Leeward Islands
late Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Irma is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is forecast during the
next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).

The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter
observations is 959 mb (28.32 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
