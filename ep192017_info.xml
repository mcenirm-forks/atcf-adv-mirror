A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ramon was
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 97.7 West.  Ramon is
moving toward the west-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and a
general westward motion with some increase in forward speed is
expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the
center of Ramon is expected to move parallel to, but remain offshore
of, the coast of southern Mexico.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Ramon is losing organization, and weakening is forecast during
the next day or two.  The cyclone is expected to dissipate by Friday
or sooner.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Ramon is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches over the Mexican
states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and southern Michoacan through Thursday,
with heaviest amounts occurring near the coast.  This rainfall
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
through this evening.
