A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ramon was
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 99.0 West.  Ramon is
moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h), and a general westward
motion is expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast
track, the center of Ramon is expected to move parallel to, but
remain offshore of, the coast of southern Mexico.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (75 km/h)
with higher gusts. Ramon is losing organization, and weakening is
forecast to continue during the next day or two.  The cyclone is
expected to dissipate by Friday or sooner.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Ramon is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches with isolated maximum amounts of 5 inches over the Mexican
states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and southern Michoacan through Thursday,
with heaviest amounts occurring near the coast.  This rainfall
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
through this evening.
