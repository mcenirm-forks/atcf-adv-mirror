WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warning in effect.

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ramon was
located near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 96.0 West. Ramon is
moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion with some increase in forward speed is expected over the
next day or two.  On the forecast track, the center of Ramon is
expected to move parallel to but remain offshore of the coast of
southern Mexico.

Satellite wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds are near
45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is
forecast during the next couple of days.

Ramon is a small tropical storm.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend
outward up to 35 miles (55 km) primarily to the west and southwest
of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Ramon is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4
inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches over the Mexican
states of Oaxaca and coastal Guerrero through Thursday. This
rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Strong gusty winds could occur along portions of the
southern coast of Mexico between Puerto Angel and Acapulco during
the next day or so.
