SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Puerto Angel to Acapulco.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 12 to
24 hours.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ramon was
located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 97.0 West.  Ramon is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and a
general westward motion with some increase in forward speed is
expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the
center of Ramon is expected to move parallel to, but remain offshore
of, the coast of southern Mexico.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is likely during the next 48
hours.

Ramon is a small tropical storm.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend
outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Ramon is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to 4
inches with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches over the Mexican
states of Oaxaca and coastal Guerrero through Thursday.  This
rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
during the next day or so.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.
