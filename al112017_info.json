A watch is typically issued 48 hours before\nthe anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,\nconditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.\n\nInterests in the remainder of the Leeward Islands, the British and\nU.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic should\nmonitor the progress of Irma.  Additional hurricane and tropical\nstorm watches and warnings will likely be required for portions of\nthis area later this morning or this afternoon.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor products\nissued by your national meteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Irma was located near\nlatitude 16.8 North, longitude 52.6 West.  Irma is moving toward the\nwest-southwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward the west is\nexpected later today, followed by a west-northwestward turn late\nTuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Irma will move closer\nto the Leeward Islands through Tuesday and then be near the northern\nLeeward Islands Tuesday night.\n\nData from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the\nmaximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Irma is a category 3 hurricane on the\nSaffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is\nforecast through Tuesday night.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from\nthe center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140\nmiles (220 km).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure estimated from data received by\nthe reconnaissance aircraft is 947 mb (27.96 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by\nTuesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by late\nTuesday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will begin affecting the northern\nLeeward Islands today.  These swells are likely to cause life-\nthreatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
