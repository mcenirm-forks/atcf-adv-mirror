A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nInterests elsewhere in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as well as\nCuba, the northwestern Bahamas, and Florida should monitor the\nprogress of Irma.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United\nStates, including possible inland watches and warnings, please\nmonitor products issued by your local National Weather Service\nforecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside\nthe United States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Irma was located near\nlatitude 18.5 North, longitude 64.7 West. Irma is moving toward the\nwest-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general motion is\nexpected to continue for the next couple of days. On the forecast\ntrack, the extremely dangerous core of Irma will continue to move\nover portions of the Virgin Islands during the next couple of\nhours, pass near or just north of Puerto Rico this afternoon or\ntonight, pass near or just north of the coast of the Dominican\nRepublic Thursday, and be near the Turks and Caicos and southeastern\nBahamas late Thursday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 185 mph (295 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely\nduring the next day or two, but Irma is forecast to remain a\npowerful category 4 or 5 hurricane during the next couple of days.\nAn unofficial observation on Buck Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands\nhas recently reported sutained winds of 106 mph (171 km/h) with a\ngust to 131 mph (211 km/h).\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185\nmiles (295 km).\n\nThe latest estimated minimum central pressure from reconnaissance\ndatat is 920 mb (27.17 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and\nlarge breaking waves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE\nLEVELS by the following amounts within the hurricane warning area\nnear and to the north of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the\nsurge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...7 to 11 ft\nTurks and Caicos Islands...15 to 20 ft\nSoutheastern Bahamas...15 to 20 ft\nNorthern coast of the Dominican Republic...3 to 5 ft\nNorthern coast of Haiti and the Gulf of Gonave...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will\ncause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising\nwaters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to\nreach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak surge occurs at\nthe time of high tide...\n\nBritish and U.S. Virgin Islands except St. Croix...7 to 11 ft\nNorthern coast of Puerto Rico...4 to 6 ft\nSouthern coast of Puerto Rico and St. Croix...2 to 4 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions will continue today within the hurricane\nwarning area in the Leeward Islands.  Hurricane conditions are\noccurring over the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and will spread\nwestward over portions of Puerto Rico later today.  Hurricane\nconditions are expected to begin within the hurricane warning area\nin the Dominican Republic and and Haiti on Thursday, with tropical\nstorm conditions beginning tonight. Hurricane conditions are\nexpected in the warning area in the southeastern Bahamas and the\nTurks and Caicos Islands beginning Thursday night.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within the\nwatch area in the central Bahamas and Cuba by Friday.\n\nRAINFALL: Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Saturday:\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20 inches\nNortheast Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands...4 to\n10 inches, isolated 15 inches\nSouthwest Puerto Rico, the southern Leeward Islands, and Saint\nCroix...2 to 4 inches\nSoutheast Bahamas and Turks and Caicos...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20\ninches\nNorthern Dominican Republic, northern Haiti, eastern and central\nCuba...4 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches\nSouthwest Haiti...1 to 4 inches\n\nIn all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods\nand mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will affect the northern Leeward\nIslands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the southeastern Bahamas,\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands, the northern coast of the Dominican\nRepublic, and portions of the southeast coast of the United States\nduring the next several days. These swells are likely to cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
