For a\ndepiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather\nService Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at\nhurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.

Irma is moving toward\nthe north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h), and an increase in\nforward speed is expected later today, with that motion continuing\nthrough Monday.  On the forecast track, the eye of Irma should move\nover the Lower Florida Keys shortly, and then move near or over the\nwest coast of the Florida Peninsula later today through tonight.\nIrma should then move inland over northern Florida and southwestern\nGeorgia Monday afternoon.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  While weakening is forecast, Irma is expected\nto remain a powerful hurricane while it moves through the Florida\nKeys and near the west coast of Florida.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220\nmiles (350 km).  A wind gust to 89 mph (143 km/h) was recently\nmeasured at the Key West National Weather Service Forecast Office.\nSustained winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) with a gust to 72 mph (117 km/h)\nwas recently reported at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall, Florida.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 929 mb (27.43 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nCape Sable to Captiva...10 to 15 ft\nCaptiva to Ana Maria Island...6 to 10 ft\nCard Sound Bridge through Cape Sable, including the Florida Keys...\n5 to 10 ft\nAna Maria Island to Clearwater Beach, including Tampa Bay...\n5 to 8 ft\nNorth Miami Beach to Card Sound Bridge, including Biscayne Bay...\n3 to 5 ft\nSouth Santee River to Fernandina Beach...4 to 6 ft\nClearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River...4 to 6 ft\nFernandina Beach to Jupiter Inlet...2 to 4 ft\nNorth of North Miami Beach to Jupiter Inlet...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and large breaking\nwaves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS by the\nfollowing amounts within the hurricane warning area near and to the\nnorth of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nNorthern coast of Cuba in the warning area...5 to 10 ft\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to continue within the\nhurricane warning area along the north coast of Cuba through\nthis morning.  Hurricane conditions are spreading across portions of\nthe Florida Keys and southern Florida.  Winds affecting the upper\nfloors of high-rise buildings will be significantly stronger than\nthose near ground level.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions\nare expected to spread northward across the remainder of the warning\nareas through Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the\nwatch area in the Northwestern Bahamas today.\n\nRAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Wednesday:\n\nWestern Cuba...Additional 3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.\nWestern Bahamas...Additional 2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.\nThe Florida Keys...15 to 20 inches, isolated 25 inches.\nThe southern Florida peninsula...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20\ninches.\nThe remainder of the Florida peninsula and southeast Georgia...8 to\n12 inches, isolated 16 inches.\nThe rest of Georgia, eastern Florida Panhandle, southern and western\nSouth Carolina, and western North Carolina...3 to 6 inches, isolated\n10 inches.\nEastern Alabama and southern Tennessee...2 to 5 inches.\n\nIn all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods\nand, in some areas, mudslides.\n\nTORNADOES:  Tornadoes are possible through tonight, mainly across\nsouthern, central, and eastern portions of the Florida Peninsula.\n\nTHE EYE: Do not venture outside when the calm eye of the hurricane\npasses over, as dangerous winds will return very quickly when the\neye moves away.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeast coast of\nthe United States.  These swells are likely to cause life-\nthreatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
