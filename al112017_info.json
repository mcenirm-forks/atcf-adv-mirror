For a\ndepiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather\nService Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at\nhurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons\nlocated within these areas should take all necessary actions to\nprotect life and property from rising water and the potential for\nother dangerous conditions.

Irma is\nmoving toward the north-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this\nmotion is expected to continue through Tuesday.  On the forecast\ntrack, the center of Irma will continue to move over southwestern\nGeorgia today, and move into eastern Alabama Tuesday morning.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Continued slow weakening is forecast, and Irma\nis likely to become a tropical depression on Tuesday.\n\nIrma remains a large tropical cyclone.  Tropical-storm-force winds\nextend outward up to 415 miles (665 km) from the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 980 mb (28.94 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nClearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River...4 t 6 ft\nTampa Bay...2 to 4 ft\nAnna Maria Island southward to Bonita Beach...1 to 3 ft\n\nSouth Santee River to Fernandina Beach...4 to 6 ft\nFernandina Beach to Flagler/Volusia County line, including the\nSt. Johns River...3 to 5 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions will continue across portions of\nthe central and northern Florida peninsula and southern Georgia.\nTropical storm conditions are spreading into the eastern Florida\nPanhandle and eastern Alabama.  Tropical storm conditions are also\nexpected to spread northward across the remainder of the warning\narea through today.\n\nRainfall:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Wednesday:\n\nNorthern Florida peninsula and southern Georgia: additional 3 to 6\ninches with storm total amounts of 8 to 15 inches.\n\nCentral Georgia, eastern Alabama and southern South Carolina: 3 to\ninches, isolated 10 inches.\n\nCentral Florida Panhandle, western Alabama, northern Mississippi,\nsouthern Tennessee, northern Georgia, northern South Carolina and\nwestern North Carolina: 2 to 4 inches.\n\nThe precipitation threat for most of the Florida peninsula, except\nfor the northernmost portions, has diminished.  Scattered showers\nare expected to produce additional rainfall amounts of less than an\ninch across most of the Florida peninsula during Monday.\n\nTORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight near the\nGeorgia and South Carolina coasts.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeast coast of\nthe United States.  These swells are likely to cause life-\nthreatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
