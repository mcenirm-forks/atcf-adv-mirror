A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are\npossible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nInterests elsewhere in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as\nwell as Cuba, the central and northwestern Bahamas, and Florida\nshould monitor the progress of Irma.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United\nStates, including possible inland watches and warnings, please\nmonitor products issued by your local National Weather Service\nforecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside\nthe United States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Irma was located near\nlatitude 17.7 North, longitude 61.8 West.  Irma is moving toward the\nwest-northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h), and this motion is expected to\ncontinue for the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the\nextremely dangerous core of Irma will move over portions of the\nnorthern Leeward Islands tonight and early Wednesday, move near or\nover portions of the northern Virgin Islands Wednesday, and pass\nnear or just north of Puerto Rico late Wednesday and Wednesday\nnight.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 185 mph (295 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely\nduring the next day or two, but Irma is forecast to remain a\npowerful category 4 or 5 hurricane during the next couple of days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175\nmiles (280 km).  A National Ocean Service automated station on\nBarbuda recently reported sustained winds of 119 mph (191 km/h) and\na wind gust of 155 mph (250 km/h).\n\nThe minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force and NOAA\nHurricane Hunter aircraft observations is 914 mb (26.99 inches).\nThe automated station on Barbuda recently reported a pressure of\n927.9 mb (27.40 in).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and\nlarge breaking waves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE\nLEVELS by the following amounts within the hurricane warning area\nnear and to the north of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the\nsurge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...7 to 11 ft\nTurks and Caicos Islands...15 to 20 ft\nSoutheastern Bahamas...15 to 20 ft\nNorthern coast of the Dominican Republic...3 to 5 ft\nNorthern coast of Haiti and the Gulf of Gonave...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will\ncause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising\nwaters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to\nreach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak surge occurs at\nthe time of high tide...\n\nBritish and U.S. Virgin Islands except St. Croix...7 to 11 ft\nNorthern coast of Puerto Rico...3 to 5 ft\nSouthern coast of Puerto Rico and St. Croix...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane\nwarning area in the Leeward Islands tonight, with tropical storm\nconditions occurring at this time.  Hurricane conditions are\nexpected to begin within the hurricane warning area in the British\nand U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Wednesday, with tropical\nstorm conditions beginning tonight.  Hurricane conditions are\nexpected to begin within the hurricane warning area in the Dominican\nRepublic early Thursday, with tropical storm conditions beginning\nWednesday night.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within the\nwatch area in Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the\nsoutheastern Bahamas by early Thursday.\n\nRAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Thursday:\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20 inches\nNortheast Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands\nexcept St. Croix...4 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches\nSouthwest Puerto Rico, the southern Leeward Islands, and\nSt. Croix...2 to 4 inches\n\nIrma is expected to produce the following rain accumulations\nWednesday through Saturday:\n\nSoutheast Bahamas and Turks and Caicos...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20\ninches\nNorthern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti...4 to 10 inches,\nisolated 15 inches\nSouthwest Haiti...1 to 4 inches\n\nThese rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will affect the northern Leeward\nIslands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the southeastern Bahamas,\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands, and the northern coast of the\nDominican Republic during the next several days.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Beven\n\nNNNN",
