Irma is moving\njust north of due west along the north coast of Cuba at near 9 mph\n(15 km/h).  A northwest motion is expected to begin later today with\na turn toward the north-northwest on Sunday.  On the forecast track,\nthe core of Irma will continue to move near or over the north coast\nof Cuba this afternoon, and will reach the Florida Keys Sunday\nmorning.  The hurricane is expected to move along or near the\nsouthwest coast of Florida Sunday afternoon.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Irma is forecast to restrengthen once it\nmoves away from Cuba, and Irma is expected to remain a powerful\nhurricane as it approaches Florida.  A NOAA plane is airborne en\nroute to investigate Irma.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195\nmiles (315 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 941 mb (27.79 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nCape Sable to Captiva...10 to 15 ft\nCaptiva to Ana Maria Island...6 to 10 ft\nCard Sound Bridge through Cape Sable, including the Florida\nKeys...5 to 10 ft\nAna Maria Island to Clearwater Beach, including Tampa Bay...5 to 8\nft\nNorth Miami Beach to Card Sound Bridge, including Biscayne Bay...4\nto 6 ft\nIsle of Palms, South Carolina to Fernandina Beach...4 to 6 ft\nClearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River...4 to 6 ft\nFernandina Beach to North Miami Beach...2 to 4 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and large breaking\nwaves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS by the\nfollowing amounts within the hurricane warning area near and to the\nnorth of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nNorthwestern Bahamas...3 to 6 ft\nNorthern coast of Cuba in the warning area...5 to 10 ft\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected to continue within the\nhurricane warning area along the north coast of Cuba through today.\nHurricane conditions are expected in portions of the northwestern\nBahamas today, and in portions of the Florida peninsula and the\nFlorida Keys tonight and Sunday.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within the\nwatch area on Sunday.\n\nRAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Wednesday:\n\nNorthern Cuba...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20 inches.\nSouthern Cuba...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.\nWestern Bahamas...3 to 6 inches, isolated 10 inches.\nThe Florida Keys...10 to 20 inches, isolated 25 inches.\nThe Florida peninsula and southeast Georgia...8 to 15 inches,\nisolated 20 inches.\nThe eastern Florida Panhandle...3 to 6 inches, isolated 8 inches.\nRest of eastern Georgia, western South Carolina, and western North\nCarolina...4 to 8 inches.\nWestern Georgia, eastern and northern Alabama, and southern\nTennessee...2 to 5 inches.\nIn all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods\nand, in some areas, mudslides.\n\nTORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight over\nsouthern Florida.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeastern\nBahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeast coast of the\nUnited States today.  These swells are likely to cause life-\nthreatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Avila\n\nNNNN",
