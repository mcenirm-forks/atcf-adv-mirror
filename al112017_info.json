For a\ndepiction of areas at risk, please see the National Weather\nService Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic, available at\nhurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.  Persons\nlocated within these areas should take all necessary actions to\nprotect life and property from rising water and the potential for\nother dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other\ninstructions from local officials.\n\nInterests elsewhere in the southeastern United States should monitor\nthe progress of Irma.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United\nStates, including possible inland watches and warnings, please\nmonitor products issued by your local National Weather Service\nforecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside\nthe United States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Irma was located\nby NOAA Doppler radar and surface observations near latitude 28.2\nNorth, longitude 82.2 West.  Irma is moving toward the north-\nnorthwest near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A turn toward the northwest at a\nfaster forward speed is expected during the next day or so.  On the\nforecast track, the center of Irma will continue to move over the\nwestern Florida peninsula through this morning and then into the\nsoutheastern United States late today and Tuesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 85 mph (135 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Irma is\nexpected to become a tropical storm over far northern Florida or\nsouthern Georgia later today.\n\nIrma has a very large wind field. Hurricane-force winds extend\noutward up to 80 miles (130 km) from the center, and tropical-storm-\nforce winds extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km).  The National\nOcean Service station at the Clearwater Beach Pier recently\nreported a wind gust of 88 mph (142 km/h), and wind gusts of\nhurricane force have been recently reported at the Orlando\nInternational and the Orlando Executive airports.\n\nThe minimum central pressure estimated from surface observations is\n960 mb (28.35 inches).  Lakeland Regional Airport recently reported\na pressure of 963.4 mb (28.45 inches) as the center passed just to\nthe west.\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nCape Sable to Captiva...4 to 6 ft\nCaptiva to Anna Maria Island...3 to 5 ft\nNorth Miami Beach to Cape Sable, including the Florida Keys...3 to 5\nft\nAnna Maria Island to Clearwater Beach, including Tampa Bay...2 to 4\nft\nSouth Santee River to Fernandina Beach...4 to 6 ft\nClearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River...4 to 6 ft\nFernandina Beach to Jupiter Inlet...3 to 5 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are continuing across portions of the\ncentral Florida peninsula.  Winds affecting the upper floors of\nhigh-rise buildings will be significantly stronger than those near\nground level.  Tropical storm conditions will continue across\nportions of southern Florida and the Florida Keys through the\nmorning.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are expected\nto spread northward across the remainder of the warning areas\nthrough today.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions\nof the warning area in the Northwestern Bahamas for the next\nseveral hours.\n\nRAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Wednesday:\n\nWestern Bahamas...Additional 2 to 4 inches.\n\nThe Florida Keys...Additional 1 inch possible with storm total\namounts from 15 to 20 inches, isolated 25 inches.\n\nWestern Florida peninsula...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20 inches.\n\nEastern Florida peninsula and southeast Georgia...8 to 12 inches,\nisolated 16 inches.\n\nThe rest of Georgia, the eastern Florida Panhandle, southern and\nwestern South Carolina, and western North Carolina...3 to 8 inches,\nisolated 12 inches.\n\nSouthern Tennessee, northern Mississippi and much of Alabama...2 to\n5 inches.\n\nIn all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.\n\nTORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible across northeast Florida\nand southeast portions of Georgia and South Carolina through\ntonight.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeast coast of\nthe United States.  These swells are likely to cause life-\nthreatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.  The center of Irma is\nbecoming less well defined in National Weather Service Doppler\nradar data, so hourly radar-based position updates are being\ndiscontinued at this time.\n\n$$\nForecaster Beven\n\nNNNN",
