Irma is\nmoving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h).  A turn toward the\nwest-northwest is forecast to begin tonight and continue for the\nnext couple of days.  On the forecast track, the extremely dangerous\ncore of Irma will move over portions of the northern Leeward Islands\ntonight and early Wednesday, move near or over portions of the\nnorthern Virgin Islands Wednesday, and pass near or just north of\nPuerto Rico late Wednesday and Wednesday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 185 mph (295 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is an extremely dangerous category 5 hurricane on the\nSaffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity\nare likely during the next day or two, but Irma is forecast to\nremain a powerful category 4 or 5 hurricane during the next couple\nof days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175\nmiles (280 km).\n\nThe minimum central pressure estimated from Hurricane Hunter\nobservations is 916 mb (27.05 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and\nlarge breaking waves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE\nLEVELS by the following amounts within the hurricane warning area\nnear and to the north of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the\nsurge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...7 to 11 ft\nTurks and Caicos Islands...15 to 20 ft\nSoutheastern Bahamas...15 to 20 ft\nNorthern coast of the Dominican Republic...3 to 5 ft\nNorthern coast of Haiti and the Gulf of Gonave...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will\ncause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising\nwaters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to\nreach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak surge occurs at\nthe time of high tide...\n\nBritish and U.S. Virgin Islands except St. Croix...7 to 11 ft\nNorthern coast of Puerto Rico...3 to 5 ft\nSouthern coast of Puerto Rico and St. Croix...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane\nwarning area in the Leeward Islands tonight, with tropical storm\nconditions beginning within the next few hours.  Hurricane\nconditions are expected to begin within the hurricane warning area\nin the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Wednesday,\nwith tropical storm conditions beginning tonight.  Hurricane\nconditions are expected to begin within the hurricane warning area\nin the Dominican Republic early Thursday, with tropical storm\nconditions beginning Wednesday night.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within the\nwatch area in Haiti, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the\nsoutheastern Bahamas by early Thursday.\n\nRAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Thursday:\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20 inches\nNortheast Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands\nexcept St. Croix...4 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches\nSouthwest Puerto Rico, the southern Leeward Islands, and\nSt. Croix...2 to 4 inches\n\nIrma is expected to produce the following rain accumulations\nWednesday through Saturday:\n\nSoutheast Bahamas and Turks and Caicos...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20\ninches\nNorthern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti...4 to 10 inches,\nisolated 15 inches\nSouthwest Haiti...1 to 4 inches\n\nThese rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will affect the northern Leeward\nIslands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the southeastern Bahamas,\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands, and the northern coast of the\nDominican Republic during the next several days.  These swells are\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
