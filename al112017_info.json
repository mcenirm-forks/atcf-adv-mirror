Preparations to protect life and property should be\nrushed to completion.\n\nA Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible\nwithin the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours before\nthe anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds,\nconditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are\npossible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nInterests in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos\nIslands, and the southeastern Bahamas should monitor the progress of\nIrma.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United\nStates, including possible inland watches and warnings, please\nmonitor products issued by your local National Weather Service\nforecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside\nthe United States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Irma was located\nby NOAA and Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 16.7\nNorth, longitude 55.0 West.  Irma is moving toward the west near 13\nmph (20 km/h) and this general motion is expected to continue into\nTuesday, followed by a turn toward the west-northwestward late\nTuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Irma will move near\nor over portions of the northern Leeward Islands Tuesday night and\nearly Wednesday.\n\nReports from the Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum\nsustained winds have increased to near 140 mph (220 km/h) with\nhigher gusts.  Irma is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is forecast during\nthe next 48 hours.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140\nmiles (220 km).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure estimated from the Hurricane\nHunter observations is 943 mb (27.85 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and large\nbreaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet\nabove normal tide levels along the coasts of the extreme northern\nLeeward Islands within the hurricane warning area near and to the\nnorth of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nThe combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause\nnormally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters\nmoving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to reach\nthe following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at the\ntime of high tide...\n\nBritish and U.S. Virgin Islands except St. Croix...4 to 6 ft\nNorthern coast of Puerto Rico...2 to 4 ft\nSouthern coast of Puerto Rico and St. Croix...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane\nwarning area by Tuesday night, with tropical storm conditions\nexpected by late Tuesday.  Hurricane conditions are possible within\nthe hurricane watch area in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by\nlate Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions possible by early\nWednesday.  Tropical Storm conditions are expected within the\ntropical storm warning area by late Tuesday.\n\nRAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations\nof 3 to 6 inches across the Leeward Islands, with isolated maximum\namounts of 10 inches across the northern Leeward Islands.  These\nrainfall amounts may cause life-threatening flash floods and\nmudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will affect the northern Leeward\nIslands during the next several days.  These swells are likely to\ncause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please\nconsult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
