For storm information specific to your area outside the\nUnited States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Irma was located\nnear latitude 26.2 North, longitude 81.8 West. Irma is moving toward\nthe north near 14 mph (22 km/h), and a north-northwestward motion\nwith an increase in forward speed is expected by tonight, with that\nmotion continuing through Monday.  On the forecast track, the eye of\nIrma should move near or over the west coast of the Florida\nPeninsula through Monday morning.  Irma should then move inland over\nnorthern Florida and southwestern Georgia Monday afternoon.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Although weakening is forecast, Irma is expected to remain\na hurricane at least through Monday morning.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from\nthe center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220\nmiles (350 km).  A mesonet site at Naples Municipal Airport\nrecently reported a sustained wind of 88 mph (142 km/h) with a gust\nto 135 mph (217 km/h) while in the northern eyewall of Irma.\n\nThe minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane\nHunter aircraft is 938 mb (27.70 inches).  A pressure of 937 mb\n(27.67 inches) was measured by a storm spotter on Marco Island while\nin Irma's eye.\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nCape Sable to Captiva...10 to 15 ft\nCaptiva to Ana Maria Island...6 to 10 ft\nCard Sound Bridge through Cape Sable, including the Florida Keys...\n5 to 10 ft\nAnna Maria Island to Clearwater Beach, including Tampa Bay...\n5 to 8 ft\nNorth Miami Beach to Card Sound Bridge, including Biscayne Bay...\n3 to 5 ft\nSouth Santee River to Fernandina Beach...4 to 6 ft\nClearwater Beach to Ochlockonee River...4 to 6 ft\nFernandina Beach to Jupiter Inlet...3 to 5 ft\nNorth of North Miami Beach to Jupiter Inlet...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are continuing across portions of the\nsouthern Florida peninsula.  Winds affecting the upper floors of\nhigh-rise buildings will be significantly stronger than those near\nground level.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are expected\nto spread northward across the remainder of the warning areas\nthrough Monday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions\nof the warning area in the Northwestern Bahamas this evening.\n\nRAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Wednesday:\n\nWestern Bahamas...Additional 2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.\n\nThe Florida Keys...Additional 3 to 6 inches with storm total amounts\nfrom 15 to 20 inches, isolated 25 inches.\n\nWestern Florida peninsula...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20 inches.\n\nEastern Florida peninsula and southeast Georgia...8 to 12 inches,\nisolated 16 inches.\n\nThe rest of Georgia, the eastern Florida Panhandle, southern and\nwestern South Carolina, and western North Carolina...3 to 8 inches,\nisolated 12 inches.\n\nSouthern Tennessee, northern Mississippi and much of Alabama...2 to\n5 inches.\n\nIn all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.\n\nTORNADOES: Tornadoes remain possible through tonight, mainly across\ncentral and eastern portions of the Florida Peninsula and extreme\nsoutheast Georgia.\n\nTHE EYE: Do not venture outside when the calm eye of the hurricane\npasses over, as dangerous winds will return very quickly when the\neye moves away.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeast coast of\nthe United States.  These swells are likely to cause life-\nthreatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Pasch\n\nNNNN",
