Irma is moving toward\nthe west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general motion is\nexpected to continue for the next couple of days.  On the forecast\ntrack, the extremely dangerous core of Irma will continue to pass\njust north of Puerto Rico tonight, pass near or just north of the\ncoast of Hispaniola Thursday, and be near the Turks and Caicos and\nsoutheastern Bahamas by Thursday evening.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 185 mph (295 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely\nduring the next day or two, but Irma is forecast to remain a\npowerful category 4 or 5 hurricane during the next couple of days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles\n(295 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 916 mb (27.05 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and\nlarge breaking waves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE\nLEVELS by the following amounts within the hurricane warning area\nnear and to the north of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the\nsurge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands...15 to 20 ft\nSoutheastern and central Bahamas...15 to 20 ft\nNorthern coast of the Dominican Republic...3 to 5 ft\nNorthern coast of Haiti and the Gulf of Gonave...1 to 3 ft\nNorthern coast of Cuba in the warning area...5 to 10 ft\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will\ncause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising\nwaters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to\nreach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak surge occurs at\nthe time of high tide...\n\nNorthern coast of Puerto Rico...2 to 4 ft\nSouthern coast of Puerto Rico...1 to 3 ft\n\nWater levels in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands will gradually\nsubside tonight and early Thursday.\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Tropical Storm and Hurricane conditions will continue to\nspread westward over portions of Puerto Rico tonight.  Hurricane\nconditions are expected to begin within the hurricane warning area\nin the Dominican Republic and Haiti early Thursday, with tropical\nstorm conditions beginning later tonight.  Hurricane conditions are\nexpected to begin in the warning area in the southeastern Bahamas\nand the Turks and Caicos Islands by late Thursday with tropical\nstorm conditions by early Thursday.  These conditions will spread\ninto the Central Bahamas by Thursday night or early Friday.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within the\nwatch area in Cuba by Friday.  Tropical storm conditions are\nexpected to begin within the warning area in Cuba Thursday night.\n\nRAINFALL: Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Saturday:\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...Additional 1 to 3 inches.  Storm total 8\nto 12 inches, isolated 20 inches.\nNortheast Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands...6 to\n12 inches, isolated 20 inches.  Southwest Puerto Rico...3 to 6\ninches, isolated 10 inches.\nThe Southern Leeward Islands, and Saint Croix...2 to 4 inches.\nSoutheast Bahamas, Central Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos...8 to\n12 inches, isolated 20 inches.\nNorthern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti...4 to 10 inches,\nisolated 15 inches.\nEastern and Central Cuba...4 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.\nSouthwest Haiti...1 to 4 inches.\n\nIn all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods\nand mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will affect the northern Leeward\nIslands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the southeastern Bahamas,\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands, the northern coast of the Dominican\nRepublic, and portions of the southeast coast of the United States\nduring the next several days.  These swells are likely to cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
