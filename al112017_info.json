Irma is moving toward\nthe west-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this motion is\nexpected to continue for the next day or so with a decrease in\nforward speed.  A turn toward the northwest is expected by late\nSaturday.  On the forecast track, the eye of Irma should continue to\nmove westward away from the Turks and Caicos Islands and toward the\nsoutheastern Bahamas this morning.  The core of the hurricane will\nthen move between the north coast of Cuba and the Bahamas during the\nnext day or two, and be near the Florida Keys and the southern\nFlorida Peninsula Sunday morning.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 155 mph (250 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely\nduring the next day or two, but Irma is forecast to remain a\npowerful category 4 hurricane during the next couple of days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185\nmiles (295 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 925 mb (27.32 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nJupiter Inlet to Bonita Beach, including Florida Keys...5 to 10 ft\nBonita Beach to Venice...3 to 5 ft\nJupiter Inlet to Sebastian Inlet...3 to 6 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and large breaking\nwaves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS by the\nfollowing amounts within the hurricane warning area near and to the\nnorth of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands...15 to 20 ft\nSoutheastern and central Bahamas...15 to 20 ft\nNorthwestern Bahamas...5 to 10 ft\nNorthern coast of Haiti and the Gulf of Gonave...1 to 3 ft\nNorthern coast of Cuba in the warning area...5 to 10 ft\n\nWIND:  Hurricane or tropical storm conditions are expected to\ncontinue within the hurricane warning area in Haiti for the next\nfew hours.  Hurricane conditions are occurring on the Turks and\nCaicos Islands.  Tropical storm and hurricane conditions are\nspreading across the southeastern Bahamas and will move into the\ncentral Bahamas later this morning.  Hurricane conditions are\nexpected within the hurricane warning area along the north coast of\nCuba late today and Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are expected in\nthe northwestern Bahamas tonight and Saturday, and in portions of\nsouthern Florida and the Florida Keys Saturday night or early\nSunday.\n\nHurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in Florida\nby Sunday, with tropical storm conditions possible by late Saturday.\n\nRAINFALL: Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Tuesday night:\n\nNorthern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti...additional 2 to 4\ninches.\nSouthern Dominican Republic and southern Haiti...additional 1 to 2\ninches.\nTurks and Caicos...additional 3 to 6 inches.\nSouthern Bahamas and northern Cuba...10 to 15 inches, isolated 20\ninches.\nSouthern Cuba...4 to 8 inches, isolated 12 inches.\nThe upper Florida Keys into southeast Florida...10 to 15 inches,\nisolated 20 inches.\nEastern Florida northward into coastal Georgia...8 to 12 inches,\nisolated 16 inches.\nLower Florida Keys...3 to 5 inches.\nWestern Florida Peninsula into much of Georgia...South\nCarolina...and Western North Carolina...3 to 6 inches.\n\nIn all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods\nand in some areas mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting Puerto Rico, the\nVirgin Islands, the southeastern Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos\nIslands, the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, and should\nstart affecting portions of the southeast coast of the United States\nlater today and tonight.  These swells are likely to cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
