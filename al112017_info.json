Preparations to protect life and\nproperty should be rushed to completion.\n\nA Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible\nwithin the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are\npossible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nInterests elsewhere in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as\nwell as Cuba, the northwestern Bahamas, and Florida should monitor\nthe progress of Irma.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United\nStates, including possible inland watches and warnings, please\nmonitor products issued by your local National Weather Service\nforecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside\nthe United States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Irma was located near\nlatitude 18.1 North, longitude 63.3 West.  Irma is moving toward the\nwest-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this general motion is\nexpected to continue for the next couple of days.  On the forecast\ntrack, the extremely dangerous core of Irma will move over portions\nof the northern Virgin Islands today, pass near or just north of\nPuerto Rico this afternoon or tonight, and pass near or just north\nof the coast of the Dominican Republic Thursday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 185 mph (295 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are likely\nduring the next day or two, but Irma is forecast to remain a\npowerful category 4 or 5 hurricane during the next couple of days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 50 miles (85 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175\nmiles (280 km).  A wind gust to 90 mph (146 km/h) was recently on\nthe island of St. Eustatius located south of the eye of Irma.  A\nNOAA National Ocean Service station on Barbuda reported sustained\nwinds of 118 mph (190 km/h) with a gust to 155 mph (249 km/h)\nbefore the instrument failed earlier this morning.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based on data from an Air\nForce Reserve aircraft and earlier surface observations is 918 mb\n(27.11 inches). A NOAA National Ocean Service station on Barbuda\nreported a minimum pressure of 916.1 mb (27.05 inches) earlier this\nmorning.\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and\nlarge breaking waves will raise water levels ABOVE NORMAL TIDE\nLEVELS by the following amounts within the hurricane warning area\nnear and to the north of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the\nsurge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...7 to 11 ft\nTurks and Caicos Islands...15 to 20 ft\nSoutheastern Bahamas...15 to 20 ft\nNorthern coast of the Dominican Republic...3 to 5 ft\nNorthern coast of Haiti and the Gulf of Gonave...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will\ncause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising\nwaters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to\nreach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak surge occurs at\nthe time of high tide...\n\nBritish and U.S. Virgin Islands except St. Croix...7 to 11 ft\nNorthern coast of Puerto Rico...3 to 5 ft\nSouthern coast of Puerto Rico and St. Croix...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions will continue today within the\nhurricane warning area in the Leeward Islands.  Hurricane\nconditions are expected to begin within the British and U.S. Virgin\nIslands this morning and spread westward over portions of Puerto\nRico later today.  Hurricane conditions are expected to begin within\nthe hurricane warning area in the Dominican Republic early Thursday,\nwith tropical storm conditions beginning tonight.  Hurricane\nconditions are expected in the warning area in the southeastern\nBahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands beginning Thursday night.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within the\nwatch area in Haiti by early Thursday and in the central Bahamas\nand Cuba by Friday.\n\nRAINFALL: Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Thursday:\n\nNorthern Leeward Islands...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20 inches\nNortheast Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin Islands...4 to\n10 inches, isolated 15 inches Southwest Puerto Rico, the southern\nLeeward Islands, and Saint Croix...2 to 4 inches\n\nIrma is expected to produce the following rain accumulations\nWednesday through Saturday:\n\nSoutheast Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos and eastern to central\nCuba...8 to 12 inches, isolated 20 inches\nNorthern Dominican Republic and northern Haiti...4 to 10 inches,\nisolated 15 inches\nSouthwest Haiti...1 to 4 inches\n\nIn all areas this rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods\nand mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will affect the northern Leeward\nIslands, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the southeastern Bahamas,\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands, the northern coast of the Dominican\nRepublic, and portions of the southeast coast of the United States\nduring the next several days. These swells are likely to cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
