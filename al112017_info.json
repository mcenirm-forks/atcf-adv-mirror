A warning is typically issued\n36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-\nforce winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous. In this case, for some of easternmost islands, the\nhurricane conditions are expected within the next 12 to 24 hours.\nPreparations to protect life and property should be rushed to\ncompletion.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are\nexpected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are\npossible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nInterests elsewhere in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, as\nwell as Cuba, the central and northwestern Bahamas, and Florida\nshould monitor the progress of Irma.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United\nStates, including possible inland watches and warnings, please\nmonitor products issued by your local National Weather Service\nforecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside\nthe United States, please monitor products issued by your national\nmeteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Irma was located near\nlatitude 16.9 North, longitude 59.1 West. Irma is moving toward the\nwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this general motion is expected to\ncontinue today, followed by a turn toward the west-northwest\ntonight. On the forecast track, the extremely dangerous core of Irma\nis forecast to move over portions of the northern Leeward Islands\ntonight and early Wednesday.\n\nReports from an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that\nthe maximum sustained winds have increased to near 185 mph (295\nkm/h) with higher gusts.  Irma is an extremely dangerous category\n5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some\nfluctuations in intensity are likely during the next day or two, but\nIrma is forecast to remain a powerful category 4 or 5 hurricane\nduring the next couple of days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160\nmiles (260 km).\n\nThe latest minimum central pressure reported by reconnaissance\naircraft is 926 mb (27.34 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a life-threatening storm surge and\nlarge breaking waves will raise water levels by as much as 7 to 11\nfeet above normal tide levels along the coasts of the extreme\nnorthern Leeward Islands within the hurricane warning area near and\nto the north of the center of Irma.  Near the coast, the surge will\nbe accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nThe combination of a life-threatening storm surge and the tide will\ncause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising\nwaters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to\nreach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at\nthe time of high tide...\n\nBritish and U.S. Virgin Islands except St. Croix...7 to 11 ft\nNorthern coast of Puerto Rico...3 to 5 ft\nSouthern coast of Puerto Rico and St. Croix...1 to 2 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane\nwarning area in the Leeward Islands by tonight, with tropical storm\nconditions beginning late this afternoon or evening. Tropical storm\nconditions are expected within the tropical storm warning area where\nhurricane conditions are also possible. Hurricane conditions are\nexpected to begin within the hurricane warning area in the British\nand U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Wednesday, with tropical\nstorm conditions beginning tonight.\n\nHurricane and tropical storm conditions are possible within the\nwatch area in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the Turks and Caicos,\nand the southeastern Bahamas by early Thursday.\n\nRAINFALL:  Irma is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 8 to 12 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 18 inches across\nthe northern Leeward Islands.  Irma is expected to produce total\nrain accumulations of 4 to 10 inches with isolated maximum amounts\nof 15 inches across northeast Puerto Rico and the British and U.S.\nVirgin Islands, and amounts of 2 to 4 inches over southwest Puerto\nRico, the southern Leeward Islands, and Saint Croix.  This rainfall\nmay cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will affect the northern Leeward\nIslands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands\nduring the next several days.  These swells are likely to cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 500 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Brown\n\nNNNN",
