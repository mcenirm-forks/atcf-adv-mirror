Irma is\nmoving toward the north-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and a turn\ntoward the northwest is expected by Tuesday morning.  On the\nforecast track, the center of Irma will continue to move over\nsouthwestern Georgia tonight and move into Alabama on Tuesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and Irma is\nlikely to become a tropical depression on Tuesday.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km)\nfrom the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations\nis 986 mb (29.12 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSTORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the\ntide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by\nrising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is\nexpected to reach the following HEIGHTS ABOVE GROUND if the peak\nsurge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nBonita Beach to Ochlockonee River, including Tampa Bay...1 to 3 ft\n\nSouth Santee River to North of Fernandina Beach...2 to 4 ft\nFernandina Beach to Flagler/Volusia County line, including the St.\nJohns River...1 to 3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast in areas of\nonshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large and\ndestructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the relative\ntiming of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over\nshort distances.  For information specific to your area, please see\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast\noffice.\n\nWIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the\nwarning area into tonight.\n\nRainfall:  Irma is expected to produce the following rain\naccumulations through Wednesday:\n\nSouth Carolina and north-central Georgia and Alabama into the\nsouthern Appalachians...3 to 6 inches with isolated 10 inches.\nNorthern Mississippi and southern portions of Tennessee and North\nCarolina...2 to 4 inches.\n\nTORNADOES: Isolated tornadoes are possible tonight along the South\nCarolina coast.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma are affecting the southeast coast of\nthe United States.  These swells are likely to cause life-\nthreatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
