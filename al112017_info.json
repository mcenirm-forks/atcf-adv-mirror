A watch is typically issued 48 hours\nbefore the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force\nwinds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or\ndangerous.\n\nInterests in the remainder of the Leeward Islands, the British and\nU.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic should\nmonitor the progress of Irma.  Additional hurricane and tropical\nstorm watches and warnings will likely be required for portions of\nthis area later today.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor\nproducts issued by your national meteorological service.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK\n------------------------------\nAt 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Irma was located near\nlatitude 16.9 North, longitude 52.3 West.  Irma is moving toward\nthe west-southwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A turn toward the west\nis expected later today, followed by a west-northwestward turn late\nTuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Irma will move\ncloser to the Leeward Islands through Tuesday and then be near the\nnorthern Leeward Islands Tuesday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Irma is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Some strengthening is forecast through\nTuesday night.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the\ncenter, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140\nmiles (220 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 961 mb (28.38 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by\nTuesday night, with tropical storm conditions possible by late\nTuesday.\n\nSURF:  Swells generated by Irma will begin affecting the northern\nLeeward Islands today.  These swells are likely to cause\nlife-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult\nproducts from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Berg\n\nNNNN",
