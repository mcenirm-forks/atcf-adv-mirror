hours.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Selma was
located near latitude 12.0 North, longitude 89.3 West. Selma is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and that general
motion is expected during the next day or so.  On the forecast
track, the center of Selma is forecast to make landfall along the
coast of El Salvador or Guatemala on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast before Selma reaches
the coast of Central America.  Rapid weakening is forecast after
landfall, and Selma is expected to dissipate over the mountains of
Central America Saturday night or early Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 6 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala, southern
Honduras and far western Nicaragua over the next couple of days.
Isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible in El Salvador
and southern Guatemala.  This rainfall could cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by early Saturday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the watch area by early Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Selma are beginning to affect portions
of the coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
