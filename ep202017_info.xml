DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Selma was
located near latitude 13.6 North, longitude 88.9 West. Selma is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion is expected through today.  On the forecast track, Selma
should quickly weaken and dissipate over Central America by tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Rapid weakening is expected through today with dissipation
by tonight.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km),
primarily to the east and southeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
2 to 5 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala, and southern
Honduras through Sunday.  This rainfall could cause isolated flash
floods, especially in mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely occurring within the
warning area.  Tropical storm conditions, primarily in gusts, are
possible within the watch area early this morning. Winds should
diminish by late morning in the warning and watch areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by Selma are affecting portions of the
coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions today.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
