SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

Interests in southeastern Guatemala and western Honduras should
monitor the progress of Selma.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Selma was
located near latitude 10.8 North, longitude 89.6 West.  Selma is
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and the cyclone is
expected to turn toward the north by early Saturday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Selma will approach the coast of El
Salvador on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some increase in strength is forecast over the next day or
so before Selma makes landfall.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 6 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala, southern
Honduras and far western Nicaragua over the next couple of days.
Isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible in El Salvador
and southern Guatemala.  This rainfall could cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by early Saturday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.

SURF:  Swells generated by Selma are forecast to affect portions
of the coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala
later today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
