Interests in western Honduras should monitor the progress of Selma.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Selma was
located near latitude 13.0 North, longitude 88.8 West. Selma is
moving toward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this
general motion is expected during the next day.  On the forecast
track Selma should make landfall in El Salvador during the next few
hours and dissipate over Central America by tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Little change in strength is anticipated before landfall, with
rapid weakening expected thereafter.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km),
primarily to the east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
2 to 5 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala and southern
Honduras through Sunday.  This rainfall could cause isolated flash
floods, especially in mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning
area soon. Tropical storm conditions, primarily in gusts, are
possible within the watch area by Saturday morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by Selma are affecting portions of the
coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.

Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
