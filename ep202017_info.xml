DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Selma
was located near latitude 14.3 North, longitude 88.8 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north-northeast near 5
mph (7 km/h), and this motion should continue until dissipation
tonight.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Dissipation is expected tonight.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
2 to 5 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala, and southern
Honduras through Sunday.  This rainfall could cause isolated flash
floods, especially in mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Gusty winds are likely to continue over El Salvador
today, but are expected to diminish by tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Selma will continue to affect portions of
the coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala
through tonight. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions today.  Please consult products from
your local weather office.

This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.
