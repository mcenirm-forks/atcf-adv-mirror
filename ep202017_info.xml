...SELMA HAS FORMED, TROPICAL STORM WARNING ISSUED FOR EL
SALVADOR...

ABOUT 210 MI...335 KM S OF SAN SALVADOR EL SALVADOR
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 5 MPH...7 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of El Salvador has issued a Tropical Storm Warning
for the entire coast of El Salvador from the Guatemala/El Salvador
border eastward to the El Salvador/Honduras border.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

Interests in southeastern Guatemala and western Honduras should
monitor the progress of Selma.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Selma was
located near latitude 10.7 North, longitude 89.5 West. Selma is
moving toward the northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h) and the cyclone is
expected to gradually turn toward the north by early Saturday.  On
the forecast track, the center of Selma will be approaching the
coast of El Salvador on Saturday.

Satellite data indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph
(65 km/h) with higher gusts.  Some increase in strength is
forecast over the next day or so before Selma makes landfall.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 6 inches of El Salvador, southern Guatemala, southern Honduras
and far western Nicaragua over the next couple of days.  Isolated
maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible in El Salvador and
southern Guatemala.  This rainfall could cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by early Saturday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.

SURF:  Swells generated by Selma are forecast to affect portions
of the coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala
later today. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
