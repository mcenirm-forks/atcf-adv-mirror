For storm information specific to your area, please monitor

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Selma was
located near latitude 12.6 North, longitude 88.9 West. Selma is
moving toward the north near 7 mph (11 km/h), and that general
motion is expected during the next 12 to 24 hours.  On the forecast
track, the center of Selma is expected to make landfall along the
coast of El Salvador this morning.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast before Selma reaches
the coast.  Rapid weakening is forecast after landfall, and Selma is
expected to dissipate over the mountains of Central America by
early Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 6 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala, southern
Honduras and far western Nicaragua through Sunday.  Isolated maximum
amounts of 10 inches are possible in El Salvador and southern
Guatemala.  This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods
and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area overnight, making outside preparations
difficult or dangerous.  Tropical storm conditions are possible
within the watch area by early Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Selma are affecting portions of the
coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
