possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 24

Interests in western Honduras should monitor the progress of Selma.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Selma was
located near latitude 11.4 North, longitude 89.5 West. Selma is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h), and the
cyclone is expected to turn toward the north by early Saturday.
On the forecast track, the center of Selma will approach the coast
of El Salvador or Guatemala on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Slight strengthening is forecast before Selma reaches the
coast of Central America.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Selma is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 6 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala, southern
Honduras and far western Nicaragua over the next couple of days.
Isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible in El Salvador
and southern Guatemala.  This rainfall could cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by early Saturday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Tropical storm conditions
are possible within the watch area by early Saturday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Selma are forecast to affect portions
of the coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala
later today.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
