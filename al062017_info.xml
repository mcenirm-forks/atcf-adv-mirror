DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Emily was
located near latitude 27.7 North, longitude 83.2 West. Emily is
moving toward the east near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general motion
is expected to continue today.  A turn toward the northeast and an
increase in forward speed are expected tonight or Tuesday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Emily is expected to move inland over
the the west-central Florida peninsula later today and move across
central Florida through tonight.  Emily is expected to move offshore
of the east-central Florida coast early Tuesday.

NOAA Doppler radar data from Tampa, Florida, indicate that maximum
sustained winds have increased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast until landfall occurs
this afternoon.  Emily is expected to weaken to a tropical
depression while it moves across the Florida peninsula tonight.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Emily is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
2 to 4 inches through Monday night along the west coast of central
Florida between the Tampa Bay area and Naples, with isolated amounts
up to 8 inches possible. Elsewhere across central and south Florida,
1 to 2 inches of rain is expected with localized amounts of up to 4
inches possible.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are likely within the warning area
through this afternoon.
