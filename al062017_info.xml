WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Emily
was located near latitude 27.5 North, longitude 81.0 West.  Emily is
moving toward the east near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the
northeast with an increase in forward speed is expected early
Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Emily will move
offshore of the east-central Florida coast Tuesday morning and then
accelerate northeastward over the western Atlantic through
Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Some strengthening is possible once Emily moves over
the Atlantic Ocean, but it could also become an extratropical low at
some point during the next couple of days.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations
is 1010 mb (29.83 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Emily is expected to produce additional rainfall of 1 to
2 inches across southern Florida and the Florida Keys, with isolated
storm totals up to 8 inches possible.
