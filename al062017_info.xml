east-central Florida coast Tuesday morning.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with
higher gusts. Some additional weakening is possible while Emily
moves across the central Florida peninsula tonight. Slow
strengthening is forecast after Emily emerges over the Atlantic

The estimated minimum central pressure based on nearby surface
