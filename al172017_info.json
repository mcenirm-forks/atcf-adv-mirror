Ophelia is\nmoving toward the northeast near 28 mph (44 km/h).  A continued\nnortheast motion with an increase in forward speed is expected\ntonight and Sunday, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast\nSunday night.  On the forecast track, the core of Ophelia will\ncontinue to pass south and east of the Azores tonight.\n\nSatellite data indicate that maximum sustained winds remain near 115\nmph (185 km/h) with higher gusts.  Ophelia is a category 3 hurricane\non the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in\nstrength is expected tonight, but the hurricane is likely to become\npost-tropical by early Monday morning, if not sooner.  Ophelia is\nforecast to remain a powerful cyclone with hurricane-force winds\nas it approaches Ireland.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles\n(205 km).  The wind field of Ophelia is forecast to expand\nsubstantially and wind and rain effects in Ireland and the UK are\nexpected to reach the coast well before the arrival of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are possible throughout the Azores\nthrough tonight, primarily due to a cold front currently passing\nthrough the islands.\n\nRAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 1 to 3 inches over the central and southeastern Azores through\nSaturday night.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.\n\n$$\nForecaster Zelinsky\n\nNNNN",
