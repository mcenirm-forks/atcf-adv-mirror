Ophelia is moving\ntoward the east-northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h), and a continued\neast-northeast motion with an increase in forward speed is forecast\nthrough Saturday evening.  A turn toward the northeast is expected\non Sunday.  On the forecast track, the core of Ophelia will pass\nsouth of the southeastern Azores by late Saturday or early Sunday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Ophelia is expected to remain a powerful cyclone for the\nnext couple of days.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles\n(150 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Tropical-storm-force winds are possible throughout the Azores\nbeginning late Saturday or Saturday night, primarily due to an\napproaching cold front.\n\nRAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations\nof 2 to 4 inches over the southeastern Azores through Saturday\nnight.  During the same time, a cold front and moisture associated\nwith Ophelia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to\n3 inches over the other islands of the Azores.
