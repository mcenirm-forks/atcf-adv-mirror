Ophelia is\nmoving toward the northeast near 35 mph (56 km/h).  A continued\nnortheastward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected\ntoday, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast tonight. On the\nforecast track, the center of Ophelia will approach Ireland on\nMonday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 105 mph (165 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Some additional weakening is expected today and\non Monday, but Ophelia is forecast to become a powerful\npost-tropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds as it approaches\nIreland on Monday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles\n(240 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).\nOphelia's eye recently passed near a drifting buoy that measured a\npressure of 970.9 mb (28.67 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nWIND:  Gale-force winds are expected to begin across southern\nIreland by early Monday morning and gradually spread northward\nacross the country during the day.  Hurricane-force winds are\nexpected to reach the southern portions of Ireland by Monday\nafternoon and spread inland across the country into Monday night.\nPreparations to protect lives and property should be rushed to\ncompletion by this afternoon.\n\nWind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and mountains\nare often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface winds\nindicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations could be\neven greater.\n\nRAINFALL:  Ophelia is expected to produce rainfall amounts of 2 to\n3 inches (50 mm to 75 mm) with isolated totals near 4 inches (100\nmm) through Tuesday across western Ireland and Scotland. Across\neastern Ireland, rainfall amounts will average around 1 inch (25 mm)\nor less.\n\nSTORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce\nsignificant coastal flooding near and to the east of where the\ncenter makes landfall.
