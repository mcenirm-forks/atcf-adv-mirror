DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dora was
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 112.3 West. Dora is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A west-
northwestward to westward motion is expected over the next couple
of days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the
next couple of days, and Dora is forecast to become a remnant low
on Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Dora will continue to affect portions
of the coast of southwest Mexico through early Wednesday, and also
affect portions of the coast of the southern Baja California
peninsula over the next day or two. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.
