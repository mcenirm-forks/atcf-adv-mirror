WATCHES AND WARNINGS

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Dora was located
near latitude 17.3 North, longitude 106.3 West.  Dora is moving
toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected over the next
48 hours.  On the forecast track, the center of Dora will remain
offshore of the coast of southwestern Mexico today and pass well to
the south of the Baja California peninsula on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible today
before weakening begins by Tuesday morning.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Dora is expected to produce rain accumulations of 1 to 2
inches along coastal sections of the Mexican states of Guerrero and
Michoacan through this evening.

SURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of the
coast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the
southern Baja California peninsula on Tuesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
