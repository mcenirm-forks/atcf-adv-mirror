...DORA STARTING TO WEAKEN...


SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.8N 109.2W
ABOUT 255 MI...405 KM WSW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
ABOUT 285 MI...460 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...989 MB...29.21 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Dora was located
near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 109.2 West. Dora is moving
toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general motion
with some decrease in forward speed is expected today and Wednesday,
with a turn toward the west expected by Thursday. On the forecast
track, the center of Dora is expected to pass over or just north of
Socorro Island later today, and remain well south of the Baja
California peninsula.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Weakening is expected during the next couple of
days, and Dora could become a remnant low by Thursday.

Satellite data indicate that Dora is a small tropical cyclone.
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds only extend outward up to 45
miles (75 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of the
coast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the
southern Baja California peninsula today through Wednesday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.
