SUMMARY OF 900 PM MDT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------

ABOUT 325 MI...525 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 PM MDT (0300 UTC), the large eye of Hurricane Dora was
located near latitude 18.4 North, longitude 108.3 West. Dora is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this
general motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected over
the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Dora
is expected to pass over or just north of Socorro Island on
Tuesday, and remain well south of the Baja California peninsula.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected during the next 48 hours, and
Dora is forecast to become a tropical storm Tuesday night or
Wednesday morning.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of the
coast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the
southern Baja California peninsula by early Tuesday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.
