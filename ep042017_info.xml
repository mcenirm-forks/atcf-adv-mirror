SUMMARY OF 300 PM MDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------

ABOUT 210 MI...335 KM SSW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
ABOUT 390 MI...630 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Dora was located
near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 107.3 West. Dora is moving
toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general
motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected over the next
couple days.  On the forecast track, the center of Dora will
continue to move away from the coast of southwestern Mexico and pass
well to the south of the Baja California peninsula on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is expected during the next 48 hours, and
Dora is forecast to become a tropical storm by Tuesday night or
Wednesday morning.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Dora is expected to produce additional rain accumulations
of up to 1 inch along coastal sections of the Mexican states of
Guerrero and Michoacan into this evening.

SURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of the
coast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the
southern Baja California peninsula on Tuesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
