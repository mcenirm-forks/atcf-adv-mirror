...DORA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN...


SUMMARY OF 900 AM MDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION

ABOUT 250 MI...400 KM S OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 300 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...990 MB...29.24 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Dora was located
near latitude 19.3 North, longitude 110.2 West.  Dora is moving
toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h.  This general motion
with some decrease in forward speed is expected today and Wednesday,
with a turn toward the west expected by Thursday. On the forecast
track, the center of Dora is expected to pass just north of Socorro
Island later today, and remain well south of the Baja California
peninsula.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours, and Dora could become a remnant low by Thursday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles
(75 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of the
coast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the
southern Baja California peninsula today through Wednesday.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.
