DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dora was
located near latitude 16.4 North, longitude 104.3 West. Dora is
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this
general motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected
over the next 48 hours. On the forecast track, the center of Dora
is expected to move parallel to but remain offshore of the coast
of southwestern Mexico.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is forecast during the
next 24 hours and Dora is expected to become a hurricane by early
Monday. Weakening is forecast to begin Monday night or Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Dora is expected to produce rain accumulations of 1 to 3
inches along coastal sections of the Mexican states of Guerrero and
Michoacan through Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of
the coast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the
southern Baja California peninsula on Tuesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
