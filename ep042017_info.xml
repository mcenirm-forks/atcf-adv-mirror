WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Dora was located
near latitude 16.7 North, longitude 105.3 West. Dora is moving
toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this
general motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected
over the next 48 hours. On the forecast track, the center of Dora
is expected to remain offshore of the coast of southwestern Mexico.

Satellite data indicate that maximum sustained winds have increased
to near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher gusts.  Some strengthening is
likely today before weakening is forecast to begin on Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles
(130 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Dora is expected to produce rain accumulations of 1 to 2
inches along coastal sections of the Mexican states of Guerrero and
Michoacan through this evening.

SURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of
the coast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread
northwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the
southern Baja California peninsula on Tuesday.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
