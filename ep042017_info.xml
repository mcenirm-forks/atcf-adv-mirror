WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dora was
located near latitude 19.6 North, longitude 111.4 West. Dora is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue through Wednesday night,
with a turn toward the west expected Thursday or Thursday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Rapid weakening is forecast during the next
36 to 48 hours, and Dora is expected to become a remnant low
Wednesday night or Thursday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.  During the past several hours, the Mexican
automated station on Socorro Island has reported wind gusts of
40 mph (65 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Dora will continue to affect portions
of the coast of southwest Mexico through Wednesday, and also affect
portions of the coast of the southern Baja California peninsula
over the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
