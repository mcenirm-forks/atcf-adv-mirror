DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nate was located
near latitude 28.4 North, longitude 89.1 West.  Nate is moving
toward the north-northwest near 23 mph (37 km/h).  A turn toward the
north and a slight decrease in forward speed are expected during the
next several hours, followed by a turn toward the north-northeast
later tonight.  A motion toward the northeast is expected on
Sunday. On the forecast track, the center of Nate will pass near or
over the mouth of the Mississippi River during the next few hours,
then make landfall along the coasts of southeastern Louisiana or
Mississippi tonight.  After landfall, the center of Nate is expected
to pass over portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee late
tonight through Sunday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible before landfall, and Nate
could still become a category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale this evening.  Rapid weakening is expected
after landfall.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km) mainly to the east of the center.  The NOAA automated
station at Southwest Pass, Louisiana, recent reported sustained
winds of 48 mph (78 km/h) and a wind gust of 60 mph (96 km/h) at an
elevation of 125 feet.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Along the northern Gulf Coast, hurricane conditions are
expected in the hurricane warning area in the next few hours, with
tropical storm conditions currently spreading onshore.  Tropical
storm conditions are expected in the tropical storm warning area
tonight and Sunday morning.  Hurricane conditions are possible in
the hurricane watch area tonight.

STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide
will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to
reach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at
the time of high tide...

Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Mississippi/Alabama border...7
to 11 ft
Mississippi/Alabama border to the Alabama/Florida border, including
Mobile Bay...6 to 9 ft
Alabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line...4 to 6
ft
Grand Isle, Louisiana to the mouth of the Mississippi River...2 to
4 ft
Okaloosa/Walton County Line to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 3 ft
Indian Pass to Crystal River, Florida...1 to 3 ft
Morgan City, Louisiana to Grand Isle...1 to 2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related
flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal
cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations through Monday:

Western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches.

East of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the
Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians:
3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches.

Across the Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians:
2 to 5 inches, max 7 inches.

TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible across parts of Alabama, the
western Florida Panhandle, western Georgia, and southern Mississippi
through Sunday afternoon.

SURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the
Gulf of Mexico during the next day or so.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
