DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nate was located
near latitude 24.5 North, longitude 87.0 West. Nate is moving toward
the north-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h), and this general fast
motion is expected to continue through tonight. A turn toward the
north is forecast on Sunday morning, followed by a turn toward the
north-northeast thereafter.  On the forecast track, the center of
Nate will move across the Gulf of Mexico today and will make
landfall along the central U.S. Gulf coast tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is possible before Nate makes landfall
along the northern Gulf coast. Another reconnaissance plane will
investigate Nate soon.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km). Cabo San Antonio in the western tip of Cuba reported
gusts to 53 mph (85 km/h) a few hours ago.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Along the northern Gulf Coast, hurricane conditions are
expected in the hurricane warning area tonight, with tropical storm
conditions expected to begin earlier. Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the tropical storm warning area tonight. Hurricane
conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area tonight and
tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area tonight and Sunday.

STORM SURGE: In the United States, the combination of a dangerous
storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the
coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the
shoreline.  The water is expected to reach the following heights
above ground if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Morgan City, Louisiana to the mouth of the Mississippi River...4 to
6 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Alabama/Florida border...5 to
9 ft
Alabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line...4 to 6
ft
Okaloosa/Walton County Line to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 4 ft
Indian Pass to Crystal River, Florida...1 to 3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related
flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal
cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations through Monday:

Eastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches.
Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches.

East of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the
Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians:
3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches.

Across the Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians:
2 to 4 inches, max 6 inches.

TORNADOES:  Isolated tornadoes will be possible beginning later
today over parts of the central Gulf Coast region.

SURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the
western Gulf of Mexico during the next day or so.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
