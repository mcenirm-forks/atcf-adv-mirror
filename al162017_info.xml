A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area. Preparations to protect life
and property should be complete.

A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline in
the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at risk, please
see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.
Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions
to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for
other dangerous conditions.  Promptly follow evacuation and other
instructions from local officials.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Nate was located
by an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft and NOAA Doppler
radar just offshore of the Mississippi coast near latitude 29.9
North, longitude 89.1 West.  Nate is moving toward the north near 20
mph (31 km/h).  A turn toward the north-northeast and northeast with
an increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  On the forecast track, Nate's center will make landfall on
the Mississippi coast within the next hour or two.  After landfall,
the center of Nate is expected to move across the Deep South,
Tennessee Valley, and central Appalachian Mountains through Monday.

Data from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that maximum
sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher gusts.  Nate
is expected to weaken quickly after landfall, and it is likely to
become a tropical storm Sunday morning.  It should degenerate into
a remnant low late Monday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125
miles (205 km).

The minimum central pressure based on aircraft data is 984 mb (29.06
inches).

A water level of 4.4 ft Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) was recently
reported by a National Ocean Service gauge at Shell Beach,
Louisiana.  The gauge at Bay Waveland Yacht Club, Mississippi,
recently reported a water level of 3.3 ft MHHW.


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane and tropical storm conditions are expected in the
hurricane warning area overnight.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected in the tropical storm warning area through Sunday morning.

STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide
will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising
waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is expected to
reach the following heights above ground if the peak surge occurs at
the time of high tide...

Mouth of the Pearl River to the Mississippi/Alabama border...7 to 11
ft
Mississippi/Alabama border to the Alabama/Florida border, including
Mobile Bay...6 to 9 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River to the mouth of the Pearl River...5
to 8 ft
Alabama/Florida border to the Okaloosa/Walton County Line...4 to 6
ft
Morgan City, Louisiana to the mouth of the Mississippi River...1 to
3 ft
Okaloosa/Walton County Line to Indian Pass, Florida...2 to 3 ft
Indian Pass to Crystal River, Florida...1 to 3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related
flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal
cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations through Monday:

Western Cuba: additional 1 to 2 inches.

East of the Mississippi River from the central Gulf Coast into the
Deep South, eastern Tennessee Valley, and southern Appalachians:
3 to 6 inches, max 10 inches.

Across the Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians:
2 to 5 inches, max 7 inches.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible across parts of Alabama,
the western Florida Panhandle, western Georgia, and southern
Mississippi through Sunday afternoon.

SURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the
Gulf of Mexico during the next day or so.  These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
