today.  On the forecast track, the depression should be nearing the
coast of Nicaragua early Thursday, move across northeastern
Nicaragua and eastern Honduras late Thursday, and emerge into the
northwestern Caribbean Sea on Friday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts.  The depression is expected to become a tropical storm later
today or tonight.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).

portions of Nicaragua, with isolated maximum amounts of 30 inches

expected, with isolated maximum totals of around 20 inches possible.
Across Honduras, rainfall amounts of 2 to 5 inches, with isolated
