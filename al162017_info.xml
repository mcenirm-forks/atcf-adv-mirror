issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Nate was
located near latitude 16.9 North, longitude 85.1 West. Nate is
moving toward the north-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and this
general track with a marked increase in forward speed is expected
during the next day or two. On the forecast track, the center of
Nate will move across the northwestern Caribbean Sea today, and
reach the eastern coast of the Yucatan peninsula early this evening.
Nate will then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico tonight and
approach the northern Gulf coast Saturday evening.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Nate
is expected to become a hurricane by the time it reaches the
northern Gulf of Mexico.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
mainly to the east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Nate is expected to produce the following rain
accumulations through this weekend:

Southern Honduras and western Nicaragua: 6-10 inches, max 15 inches
Eastern El Salvador and northern to central Honduras: 3 to 5 inches,
max 8 inches
Eastern Yucatan and western Cuba: 2 to 4 inches, max 8 inches
Eastern Belize and the Cayman Islands: 1 to 3 inches

U.S. Central Gulf Coast states: 3 to 6 inches, max 12 inches

Heavy rainfall will occur over a wide area, including locations well
away from the center along the Pacific coast of Central America.
Rainfall across all of these areas may produce life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue within
portions of the warning area in Honduras during the next few
hours, but gradually subside.  Hurricane conditions are possible
within the hurricane watch area in Mexico by tonight, with tropical
storm conditions expected by late this evening.

Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch areas along
the U.S. Gulf coast beginning Saturday evening, with hurricane
conditions possible in the hurricane watch area Saturday night.

STORM SURGE:  A storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1
to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in
areas of onshore winds on the Yucatan Peninsula and the adjacent
islands.  Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and
destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Nate will affect land areas around the
northwestern Caribbean during the next day or two.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
