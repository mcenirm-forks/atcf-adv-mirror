DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Don was
located near latitude 11.5 North, longitude 58.7 West.  Don is
moving toward the west near 20 mph (31 km/h).  This general motion
is expected through Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Don will move across the Windward Islands later today or tonight,
and then move westward across the southeastern Caribbean Sea on
Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast before Don moves
through the Windward Islands.  The tropical storm is forecast to
degenerate into a trough of low pressure over the southeastern
Caribbean late Wednesday or Wednesday night.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1011 mb (29.86 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected in the warning area
by late this afternoon and tonight.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area beginning later today.

RAINFALL:  Don is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher amounts across Barbados,
Trinidad and Tobago, and the southern Windward Islands through
Wednesday.  These rains could produce life-threatening flash floods
and mudslides, especially in mountainous areas.
