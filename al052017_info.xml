DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Don was
located near latitude 11.9 North, longitude 61.4 West.  Don is
moving toward the west near 23 mph (37 km/h).  This general motion
is expected through Wednesday.  On the forecast track, the center of
Don will move across the Windward Islands within the next few hours,
and then move westward across the southeastern Caribbean Sea late
tonight and Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 24
hours.  The system is forecast to degenerate into a trough of low
pressure tonight or Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1011 mb (29.85 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread across the
Windward Islands within the warning area during the next several
hours.

RAINFALL:  Don is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher amounts, across Trinidad and
Tobago and the southern Windward Islands through Wednesday.  These
rains could produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,
especially in mountainous areas.
