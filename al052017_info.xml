NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052017
1100 PM AST Tue Jul 18 2017

...DON DEGENERATES TO AN OPEN WAVE OVER THE FAR SOUTHEASTERN
CARIBBEAN SEA...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...


SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...11.9N 62.5W
ABOUT 55 MI...90 KM WSW OF GRENADA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 25 MPH...41 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1012 MB...29.89 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of Trinidad and Tobago has discontinued the Tropical
Storm Warning for Grenada.  The government of Barbados has
discontinued the Tropical Storm Warning for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches and warnings in effect.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
Data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate
that Don no longer has a center of circulation.  At 1100 PM AST
(0300 UTC), the remnants of Don were located near latitude 11.9
North, longitude 62.5 West.  The remnants are moving quickly toward
the west near 25 mph (41 km/h), and this motion is expected to
continue during the next couple of days.

The aircraft data indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 40
mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.  These winds are occurring over
the waters of the far southeastern Caribbean Sea.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
to the north of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1012 mb (29.89 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Gusts to tropical storm force in squalls are still possible
across the Windward Islands overnight.

RAINFALL:  The remnants of Don are expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated higher amounts, across
Trinidad and Tobago, the southern Windward Islands, and northeastern
Venezuela through Wednesday.  These rains could produce
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially in
mountainous areas.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  Additional information on this system can be
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service,
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and available
