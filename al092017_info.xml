DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was
located near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 56.5 West.  Harvey is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue for the next couple of days.  On the forecast
track, Harvey should move through the Windward Islands and into the
eastern Caribbean Sea on Friday.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter Aircraft
indicate that maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Slow strengthening is possible during the next 48
hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) to
the north of the center.

The latest minimum central pressure reported by the Hurricane Hunter
aircraft is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
Lesser Antilles within the warning area by early Friday, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area on Friday.

RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches across portions of the Windward Islands from
Martinique southward to Grenada.   These rains could cause
