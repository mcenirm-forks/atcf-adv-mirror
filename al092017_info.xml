Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding is occurring in
southeastern Texas, and flash flood emergencies are in effect
for portions of this area.  Please see warnings and other products
issued by your local National Weather Service office for additional
information on this life-threatening situation.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was
located near latitude 29.0 North, longitude 97.2 West. Harvey is
moving toward the southeast near 2 mph (4 km/h), and a slow
southeastward to east-southeastward motion is expected over the next
couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center will move very
near the coast of southeastern Texas on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
primarily over water to the east and northeast of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 15 to 25 inches through Friday over the middle and
upper Texas coast, including the Houston/Galveston metropolitan
area. Isolated storm totals may reach 50 inches in this region.
These rains are currently producing catastrophic and life-
threatening flooding, and flash flood emergencies are in effect
for portions of southeastern Texas. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE
AFFECTED AREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE PLACE. DO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED
ROADWAYS.  Please see warnings and other products issued by your
local National Weather Service office for additional information on
this dire and life-threatening situation.

Elsewhere, Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 5 to 15 inches farther south toward the lower Texas coast,
farther west toward the Texas Hill Country, and farther east
through southwest and central Louisiana.

A list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather
Prediction Center can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Port Aransas to High Island including Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft
High Island to Morgan City...1 to 2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the
area of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in an area near the
center and over portions of the tropical storm warning area along
the coast.  Tropical storm conditions are likely to persist in
areas of onshore flow within the warning area during the next day
or so.

SURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the coasts of Texas
and Louisiana.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight near
the middle and upper Texas coast into southwest Louisiana.
