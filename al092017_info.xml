DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was
located near latitude 13.0 North, longitude 60.3 West. Harvey is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and a continued
westward motion with a slight increase in forward speed is expected
over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, Harvey should
move through the Windward Islands and into the eastern Caribbean Sea
this morning.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible during the next 48
hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
mainly to the north of the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve
Hurricane Hunter aircraft data is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).  The
Grantley Adams International Airport on Barbados recently reported a
pressure of 1006 mb (29.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are spreading through the warning
area at this time, making outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the watch area
today.

RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches across portions of the Windward Islands from Martinique
southward to Grenada.   These rains could cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.
