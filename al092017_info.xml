WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Storm Surge Warning and the Tropical Storm Warning
are discontinued north of Sargent Texas.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Storm Surge Warning is in effect for...
* Port Aransas to Sargent Texas

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Baffin Bay to Sargent Texas

A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline in the
indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at risk, please see
the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov. This is a life-threatening situation.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was
located near latitude 29.3 North, longitude 97.3 West. Harvey is
drifting east-northeastward. A drift toward the south or southeast
is expected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast track,
the center of Harvey is expected to remain inland over southeastern
Texas.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours, and Harvey is likely to weaken to a tropical depression on
Sunday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.  During the past few hours, the airport at New
Braunfels, Texas has reported sustained winds of 41 mph (67 km/h)
and a gust of 58 mph (93 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb (29.36 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 15 to 25 inches over the middle and upper Texas
coast through Thursday. Isolated storm totals may reach around
40 inches in this area. Rainfall of this magnitude will cause
catastrophic and life-threatening flooding. Elsewhere during the
same time period, Harvey is expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 5 to 15 inches farther south toward the lower Texas
coast, farther west toward the the Texas Hill Country, and farther
east through southwest and central Louisiana. A list of rainfall
observations compiled by the NOAA Weather Prediction Center can be
found at: www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Port Aransas to Sargent...3 to 6 ft
Sargent to High Island including Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft
High Island to Morgan City...1 to 2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the
area of onshore winds, where the surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

WIND:   Tropical storm conditions are occurring in an area near the
center and over portions of the tropical storm warning area along
the coast.  These conditions are likely to persist through Sunday
morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by Harvey affecting the coasts of Texas
and Louisiana should subside through Sunday morning.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through Monday near the
middle and upper Texas coast into far southwest Louisiana.
