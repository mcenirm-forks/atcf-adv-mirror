this life-threatening situation.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was
located inland near latitude 28.9 North, longitude 96.8 West. Harvey
is moving toward the southeast near 3 mph (4 km/h), and a slow
southeastward motion is expected over the next couple of days. On
the forecast track, the center of Harvey is forecast to move off the
middle Texas coast on Monday and meander just offshore through
Monday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 24
hours.  Some slight restrengthening is possible after the center
moves off the coast on Monday night and Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
primarily over water to the east of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 15 to 25 inches through Friday over the upper Texas
coast and into southwestern Louisiana. Isolated storm totals may
reach 50 inches over the upper Texas coast, including the Houston/
Galveston metropolitan area.  These rains are currently producing
catastrophic and life-threatening flooding, and flash flood
emergencies are in effect for portions of southeastern Texas.
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE AFFECTED AREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE
PLACE.  DO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED ROADWAYS.  Please see warnings and
products issued by your local National Weather Service office for
additional information on this life-threatening situation.

Elsewhere, Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
5 to 15 inches farther south into the middle Texas coast, farther
west toward the Texas Hill Country, and farther east across south-
central Louisiana.

A list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather
Prediction Center can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Port Aransas to Morgan City including Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the
area of onshore winds.  Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in an area near the
center of Harvey and in portions of the tropical storm warning area
along the coast.  Tropical storm conditions are likely to persist in
areas of onshore flow within the warning area during the next day or
so.  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area by
Monday night.

SURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the coasts of Texas
and Louisiana.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through Monday near the
upper Texas coast and into far southwest Louisiana.
