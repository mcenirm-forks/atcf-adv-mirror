SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Mesquite Bay to High Island

Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding continues in southeastern
Texas, and flash flood emergencies are in effect for portions of
this area.  Please see warnings and other products issued by your
local National Weather Service office for additional information on
this life-threatening situation.

Interests elsewhere along the upper Texas coast and in southwestern
Louisiana should continue to monitor the progress of Harvey.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was
located near latitude 28.6 North, longitude 96.3 West. Harvey is
moving toward the southeast near 3 mph (6 km/h) and a slow
southeastward motion is expected today.  A slow northeastward motion
is expected to begin on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center
of Harvey is forecast to move off the middle Texas coast this
morning, and remain just offshore through Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slight restrengthening is possible after the center moves off
the coast later today and Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 15 to 25 inches through Friday over the upper Texas
coast and into southwestern Louisiana.  Isolated storm totals may
reach 50 inches over the upper Texas coast, including the Houston/
Galveston metropolitan area.  These rains are currently producing
catastrophic and life-threatening flooding, and flash flood
emergencies are in effect for portions of southeastern Texas.
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE AFFECTED AREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE
PLACE.  DO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED ROADWAYS.  Please see warnings and
products issued by your local National Weather Service office for
additional information on this life-threatening situation.

Elsewhere, Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
5 to 15 inches farther south into the middle Texas coast, farther
west toward the Texas Hill Country, and farther east across south-
central Louisiana.

A list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather
Prediction Center can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Port Aransas to Morgan City including Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the
area of onshore winds.  Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in rain bands well to
the east of the center of Harvey, including portions of the tropical
storm warning area along the coast.  Tropical storm conditions are
likely to persist in areas of onshore winds within the warning area
during the next couple of days.

SURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the coasts of Texas
and Louisiana.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight from the
upper Texas coast across parts of southwestern and south-central
Louisiana.
