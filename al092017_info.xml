SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding continues in southeastern
Texas and portions of southwestern Louisiana.  Please see warnings
and other products issued by your local National Weather Service
office for additional information on this life-threatening
situation.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Harvey
was located near latitude 31.2 North, longitude 92.6 West. Harvey is
moving toward the north-northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue tonight.  A turn toward the northeast
is expected Thursday or Thursday night.  On the forecast track, the
center of Harvey should move through central Louisiana tonight, then
move through northeastern Louisiana and northwestern Mississippi
Thursday and Thursday night.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h)
with higher gusts. Additional gradual weakening is forecast during
the next 48 hours as Harvey moves farther inland.

The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations
is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 4 to 8 inches from southwestern Louisiana and the
adjacent border of eastern Texas northeastward into western
Tennessee and Kentucky through Friday with isolated amounts up to 12
inches.  The threat of heavy rains has ended in the Houston/
Galveston area. However catastrophic and life threatening flooding
will continue in and around Houston, Beaumont/Port Arthur, eastward
into southwest Louisiana for the rest of the week.  The expected
heavy rains spreading northeastward from Louisiana into western
Kentucky may also lead to flash flooding and increased river and
small stream flooding.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE AFFECTED
AREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE PLACE. DO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED
ROADWAYS.  Please see warnings and products issued by your local
National Weather Service office for additional information on this
life-threatening situation.

Elsewhere, the outer bands of Harvey are expected to produce
additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches over portions of the
central and eastern Gulf States and 2 to 4 inches farther north into
parts of the Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley and southern Mid Atlantic
through Saturday.  These rains may lead to flooding concerns across
these areas.

A list of preliminary rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA
Weather Prediction Center can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

San Luis Pass to Grand Isle...1 to 2 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the
area of onshore winds. Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances. For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are still possible over
portions of southern Louisiana and Mississippi tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are still affecting the coast of
Louisiana, but are expected to subside late tonight and Thursday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through this evening across
parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, western Alabama, and southeast
Arkansas. Additional tornadoes are possible on Thursday afternoon
and evening across northern portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and
Georgia into parts of Tennessee.
