DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was
located near latitude 13.1 North, longitude 59.1 West. Harvey is
moving toward the west near 18 mph (30 km/h), and a continued
westward motion with a slight increase in forward speed is expected
over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, Harvey should
move through the Windward Islands and into the eastern Caribbean Sea
later today.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible during the next 48
hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
mainly to the north of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
Lesser Antilles within the warning area later this morning, making
outside preparations difficult or dangerous.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area later today.

RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce rainfall totals of 2 to 4
inches across portions of the Windward Islands from Martinique
southward to Grenada.   These rains could cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides.
