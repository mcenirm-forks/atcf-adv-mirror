A Tropical Storm Watch has been issued east of Cameron to
Intracoastal City, Louisiana.

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* East of Cameron to Intracoastal City

Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding continues in southeastern
Texas.  Please see warnings and other products issued by your
local National Weather Service office for additional information on
this life-threatening situation.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the middle and upper Texas coast and in
southern Louisiana should continue to monitor the progress of
Harvey.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Harvey was
located near latitude 28.5 North, longitude 96.0 West. Harvey is
moving toward the southeast near 5 mph (7 km/h), and a slow motion
toward the southeast is expected through tonight.  A gradual turn
toward the northeast and a continued slow forward speed are expected
Tuesday and Tuesday night.  On the forecast track, the center of
Harvey is expected to be just offshore of the middle and upper
coasts of Texas through Tuesday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some slow intensification is possible during the next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
mainly to the east of the center.

The minimum central pressure estimated from surface observations
along the Texas coast is 997 mb (29.44 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Harvey is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 15 to 25 inches through Friday over the upper Texas
coast and into southwestern Louisiana.  Isolated storm totals may
reach 50 inches over the upper Texas coast, including the Houston/
Galveston metropolitan area.  These rains are currently producing
catastrophic and life-threatening flooding over large portions
of southeastern Texas.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL IN THE AFFECTED
AREA IF YOU ARE IN A SAFE PLACE.  DO NOT DRIVE INTO FLOODED
ROADWAYS. Please see warnings and products issued by your local
National Weather Service office for additional information on this
life-threatening situation.

Elsewhere, Harvey is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
5 to 15 inches farther south into the middle Texas coast and farther
east across south-central Louisiana.  Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10
inches are expected in southeast Louisiana.

A list of rainfall observations compiled by the NOAA Weather
Prediction Center can be found at:
www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc1.html

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water is
expected to reach the following heights above ground if the peak
surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Port Aransas to Morgan City including Galveston Bay...1 to 3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near the
area of onshore winds.  Surge-related flooding depends on the
relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary
greatly over short distances.  For information specific to your
area, please see products issued by your local National Weather
Service forecast office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are occurring in rain bands well to
the east of the center of Harvey, including portions of the tropical
storm warning area along the coast.  Tropical storm conditions are
likely to persist in areas of onshore winds within the warning area
during the next couple of days, and are possible in the watch area
by Wednesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Harvey are affecting the coasts of Texas
and Louisiana.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.

TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible today and tonight from
extreme southeast Texas across parts of southern Louisiana.
