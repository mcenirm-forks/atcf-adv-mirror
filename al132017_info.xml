WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of Mexico has issued a Hurricane Watch for the coast
of the state of Veracruz from Tuxpan to Laguna Verde.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Tuxpan to Laguna Verde

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Katia was located
near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 95.1 West. Katia is moving
toward the southeast near 3 mph (6 km/h). Little overall motion is
anticipated through tonight, but a southwestward drift should begin
tomorrow.

Data from the Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum
sustained winds have increased to near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles
(95 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
5 to 10 inches over northern Veracruz, and 2 to 5 inches over far
southern Tamaulipas, northeast Puebla, and southern Veracruz through
Saturday morning. Isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible
in northern Veracruz. This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash
floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
late Friday, with tropical storm conditions possible earlier that
day.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.
