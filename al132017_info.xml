SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Hurricane Warning is in effect for...
* Cabo Rojo to Laguna Verde

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* North of Cabo Rojo to Rio Panuco
* South of Laguna Verde to Puerto Veracruz.

A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  A warning is typically issued
36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-
storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations
difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life and property
should be rushed to completion.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Katia was located
near latitude 21.4 North, longitude 95.2 West. Katia is moving
toward the west-southwest near 3 mph (6 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue until the system makes landfall by
early Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next day or so and
Katia could be near major hurricane strength at landfall.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60
miles (95 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure based on Air Force Hurricane
Hunter data is 982 mb (29.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels near and to the
north of where Katia makes landfall.  Near the coast, the surge will
be accompanied by large and destructive waves.

RAINFALL: Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 10 to 15 inches over northern Veracruz and eastern Hidalgo,
and Puebla.  Katia is also expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 2 to 5 inches over southern Tamaulipas, eastern
San Luis Potosi, western Hidalgo, eastern Queretaro, and southern
Veracruz through Saturday evening.  Isolated maximum amounts of 25
inches are possible in northern Veracruz and eastern Hidalgo,
Puebla, and San Luis Potosi.  This rainfall may cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of
mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within portions of the
hurricane warning area by tonight or early Saturday, with
tropical storm conditions expected within the tropical storm warning
areas by later today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Katia will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southeastern Mexico during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
