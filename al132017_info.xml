WATCHES AND WARNINGS

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Katia was
located near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 95.9 West. Katia is
moving slowly toward the east-southeast near 5 mph (7 km/h), and
little motion is expected during the next day or so.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast and Katia could become a hurricane
before it approaches the coast of Veracruz in a couple of days. An
Air Force reconnaissance plane will check Katia later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------

RAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
5 to 10 inches over northern Veracruz, and 2 to 5 inches over far
southern Tamaulipas, northeast Puebla, and southern Veracruz through
Saturday morning. Isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible
in northern Veracruz. This rainfall may cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous
terrain.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.
