SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

* Rio Panuco to Puerto Veracruz

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Katia was
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 97.5 West. Katia is
moving toward the west near 2 mph (4 km/h) and it is expected to
drift to the east of the Sierra Madre Mountains as it dissipates
today.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Winds should continue to subside as Katia dissipates today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  Some inundation along the coast due to storm surge
will remain possible this morning.  Water levels along the coast
should decrease as the storm moves inland and winds subside.

RAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
10 to 15 inches over northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, and
Puebla.  Katia is also expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 5 inches over southern Tamaulipas, eastern San Luis Potosi,
western Hidalgo, eastern Queretaro, and southern Veracruz through
Saturday evening.  Isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches are
possible in northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, Puebla, and San
Luis Potosi. This rainfall will likely cause life-threatening flash
floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue within the
tropical storm warning areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by Katia will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southeastern Mexico during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
