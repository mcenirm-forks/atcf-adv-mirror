SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Rio Panuco to Puerto Veracruz

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Katia was
located near latitude 20.3 North, longitude 97.4 West. Katia is
moving toward the southwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general
motion is expected to continue until dissipation today.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (70 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is forecast.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 65 miles (100 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 998 mb (29.47 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  Some inundation along the coast due to storm surge
will remain possible this morning.  Water levels along the coast
should begin to decrease as the storm moves inland and winds
subside.

RAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
10 to 15 inches over northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, and
Puebla.  Katia is also expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 5 inches over southern Tamaulipas, eastern San Luis Potosi,
western Hidalgo, eastern Queretaro, and southern Veracruz through
Saturday evening.  Isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches are
possible in northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, Puebla, and San
Luis Potosi. This rainfall will likely cause life-threatening flash
floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue within the
tropical storm warning areas.

SURF:  Swells generated by Katia will continue to affect portions of
the coast of southeastern Mexico during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
