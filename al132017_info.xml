WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of Mexico has discontinued all Tropical Storm
Warnings.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

None.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Katia
was located near latitude 20.1 North, longitude 97.7 West. Katia is
moving toward the west-southwest near 2 mph (4 km/h) and it is
expected to continue drifting toward the west-southwest until
dissipation.

Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher
gusts. Katia is expected to dissipate over the mountains of
Mexico later today.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
10 to 15 inches over northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, and
Puebla.  Katia is also expected to produce total rain accumulations
of 2 to 5 inches over southern Tamaulipas, eastern San Luis Potosi,
western Hidalgo, eastern Queretaro, and southern Veracruz through
Saturday evening.  Isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches are
possible in northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo, Puebla, and San
Luis Potosi. This rainfall will likely cause life-threatening flash
floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous terrain.

STORM SURGE: Water levels along the coast should continue to
decrease as the center dissipates and winds subside.

SURF:  Swells generated by Katia will begin to decrease along the
coast of southeastern Mexico today. These swells may still cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.
