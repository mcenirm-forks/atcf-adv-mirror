WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Hurricane Watch is in effect for...
* Cabo Rojo to Laguna Verde

A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.

Hurricane warnings will likely be issued later this morning for a
portion of the watch area.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 AM CDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Katia was located
near latitude 21.6 North, longitude 94.7 West.  Katia is drifting
toward the east-southeast near 2 mph (4 km/h).  Little overall
motion is anticipated through late today, but then the hurricane
is forecast to turn southwestward and approach the coast within the
watch area late Friday or early Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours and
Katia could be near major hurricane strength at landfall.

Katia is a small tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 10 miles (20 km) from the center and tropical-storm-
force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 5 to 7 feet above normal tide levels along the
immediate coast within portions of the hurricane watch area.  Near
the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.

RAINFALL:  Katia is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
5 to 10 inches over northern Veracruz, and 2 to 5 inches over far
southern Tamaulipas, northeast Puebla, and southern Veracruz through
Saturday morning. Isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches are possible
in northern Veracruz.  This rainfall may cause life-threatening
flash floods and mudslides, especially in areas of mountainous
terrain.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area by
late Friday, with tropical storm conditions possible early Friday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Katia are expected to affect portions of
the coast of southeastern Mexico today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
