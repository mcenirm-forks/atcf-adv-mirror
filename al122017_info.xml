* Nantucket

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson

36 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
by an an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude
36.9 North, longitude 71.5 West. Jose is moving toward the north
near 7 mph (11 km/h). This general motion is expected to continue
through today, followed by a turn to the northeast tonight. On
the forecast track, the center of Jose is forecast to pass well
offshore of the Delmarva peninsula later today, pass well to the
east of the New Jersey coast on Wednesday, and pass offshore of
southeastern Massachusetts by Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is expected today, but Jose should
begin to gradually weaken on Wednesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 310
miles (500 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area early Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area beginning tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
1 to 3 inches over eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut,
southern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts. Rainfall
amounts of 3 to 5 inches are expected for Martha's Vineyard,
Nantucket and Cape Cod through Wednesday.  This rainfall could cause
isolated flooding.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.
