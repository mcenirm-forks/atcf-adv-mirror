BULLETIN
Hurricane Jose Advisory Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL122017
500 PM EDT Sat Sep 16 2017

...JOSE MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWARD WITH 80-MPH WINDS...
...LIFE-THREATENING RIP CURRENTS EXPECTED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES...


SUMMARY OF 500 PM EDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...28.9N 71.9W
ABOUT 485 MI...780 KM SSE OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA
ABOUT 485 MI...775 KM WSW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...973 MB...28.74 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests from North Carolina northward to New England on the east
coast of the United States should monitor the progress of this
system.  Tropical storm watches may be needed for portions of this
area during the next day or two.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 28.9 North, longitude 71.9 West.  Jose is moving
toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this general motion with
an increase in forward speed is expected through Monday.

Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate
that maximum sustained winds remain near 80 mph (130 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible over the
next couple of days, but Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane
through Monday.

The aircraft data indicate that Jose has increased in size.
Hurricane-force winds now extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to
185 miles (295 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the northern coasts of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and much of the
U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause dangerous surf and
rip current conditions for the next several days in these areas.
For more information, please consult products from your local
weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.
