U.S. EAST COAST...


SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...25.5N 68.0W
ABOUT 375 MI...605 KM NE OF THE SOUTHEASTERN BAHAMAS
ABOUT 510 MI...815 KM SSW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests from North Carolina northward to New England on the east
coast of the United States should monitor the progress of this
system.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 25.5 North, longitude 68.0 West. Jose is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A gradual
turn toward the north is expected during the next two days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours,
and Jose is expected to regain hurricane status on Friday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the northern coasts of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and the Southeast
coast of the United States, and will spread northward along the
Mid-Atlantic coast of the U.S. during the next few days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  For more information, please consult products from your
local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.
