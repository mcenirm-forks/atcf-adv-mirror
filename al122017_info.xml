WATCHES AND WARNINGS

CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Fenwick Island to Sandy Hook
* Delaware Bay South
* East Rockaway Inlet to Plymouth
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM EDT (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 33.5 North, longitude 71.2 West. Jose is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is expected
to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the north-northeast is
expected on Tuesday night.  On the forecast track, the center of
Jose is forecast to pass well offshore of the Outer Banks of North
Carolina today, pass well east of the Delmarva peninsula tonight and
Tuesday, and pass well to the east of the New Jersey coast on
Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of
days, however, Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane through
Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).

The minimum central pressure based on NOAA and Air Force data is 976
mb (28.82 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut,
southern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts, including
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket through Wednesday. Jose is also
expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches along
the mid-Atlantic coast, and from southeast New York to coastal
Maine. This rainfall could cause isolated flooding.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.
