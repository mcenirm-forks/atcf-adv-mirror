SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 23.7 North, longitude 68.1 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this motion is expected to
continue overnight, followed by a reduction in forward speed and a
turn toward the north on Monday. Jose is then forecast to move
slowly toward the east and southeast on Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts. Jose is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Steady weakening is forecast during the
next couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 962 mb (28.41 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose will affect portions of Hispaniola,
the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the next couple
of days. These swells are likely to produce high surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.
