DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 24.4 North, longitude 68.6 West. Jose is moving toward
the north-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h), and a turn toward the
northeast is expected by tonight, with a reduction in forward speed.
Jose is then expected to move slowly toward the east and southeast
Tuesday into Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher
gusts. Steady weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose will affect portions of Hispaniola,
the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the next couple
of days. These swells are likely to produce high surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
