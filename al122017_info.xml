THE UNITED STATES...


SUMMARY OF 800 PM EDT...0000 UTC...INFORMATION

ABOUT 315 MI...510 KM SE OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA
ABOUT 405 MI...650 KM W OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Fenwick Island to Sandy Hook
* Delaware Bay South
* East Rockaway Inlet to Plymouth
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM EDT (0000 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
by NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aicraft near latitude
31.9 North, longitude 71.7 West. Jose is moving toward the north
near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is expected during the
next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Jose is
forecast to remain offshore of the U.S. east coast.

Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible over the next
couple of days, but Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane through
Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).

The latest minimum central pressure reported by reconnaissance
aircraft is 972 mb (28.70 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL...Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3
to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southern Rhode Island, and
southeast Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket
through Wednesday. Jose is also expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches along the Mid Atlantic coast, and
from southeast New York to coastal Maine. This rainfall could cause
isolated flooding.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.
