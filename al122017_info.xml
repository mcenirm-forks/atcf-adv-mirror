* Watch Hill to Hull
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson
* New Haven to Watch Hill

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 24 to
36 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 36.0 North, longitude 71.3 West. Jose is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h).  This general motion is expected to
continue through today with a turn to the northeast anticipated
tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of Jose is forecast to
pass well offshore of the Delmarva peninsula later today, pass
well to the east of the New Jersey coast on Wednesday, and pass
offshore of southeastern Massachusetts by Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected today but Jose
should begin to gradually weaken on Wednesday.

Jose is a large tropical cyclone.  Hurricane-force winds extend
outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the center and tropical-storm-
force winds extend outward up to 310 miles (500 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 971 mb (28.68 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area early Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area beginning tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 1
to 3 inches over  eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut,
southern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts. 3 to 5 inches
are expected for Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and Cape Cod through
Wednesday. This rainfall could cause isolated flooding. Jose is also
expected to produce total rain accumulations less than inch along
the northern mid-Atlantic coast, and from southeast New York to
coastal Maine through Wednesday.

Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.
