DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Jose
was located near latitude 39.7 North, longitude 68.7 West.  The
post-tropical cyclone is moving slowly toward the west near 2 mph
(4 km/h).  Jose is expected to meander well off the coast of New
England for the next several days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is forecast for the next 48 hours.

Jose is a large system.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward
up to 220 miles (350 km) from the center.  A sustained wind of 43
mph (69 km/h) with a gust to 53 mph (85 km/h) was recently reported
at an unofficial observing site on Block Island.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in the
warning area this morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next couple of days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

Rainfall: Jose is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of up to one inch across Cape Cod and the offshore
Islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket through early Saturday.
When including rain that has already fallen, storm total
accumulations could reach 6 inches on Nantucket.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.
