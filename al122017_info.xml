For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 39.0 North, longitude 70.0 West.  Jose is
moving toward the northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected to continue
through tonight.  A slow westward motion is expected to begin on
Thursday.  On the forecast track, the center of Jose is expected to
pass well to the east of the New Jersey coast today, and pass
offshore of southeastern Massachusetts on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.

Jose is a large system.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward
up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center.

The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force
Hurricane Hunters is 976 mb (28.82 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area later today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next several days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall accumulations through Thursday:

Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod...1 to 2 inches.
Nantucket...2 to 4 inches.

These rainfall totals could cause isolated flash flooding.
