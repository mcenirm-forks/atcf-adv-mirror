SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Fenwick Island to Sandy Hook
* Delaware Bay South
* East Rockaway Inlet to Plymouth
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 32.6 North, longitude 71.6 West.  Jose is moving
toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion is
expected to continue through tonight.  A turn toward the
north-northeast is expected on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Jose is forecast to pass well offshore of the Outer Banks
of North Carolina today, and pass well east of the Delmarva
peninsula tonight and Tuesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected during the next day or
so, and Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane through Tuesday
night.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 972 mb (28.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL...Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3
to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southern Rhode Island, and
southeast Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket
through Wednesday.  Jose is also expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches along the Mid Atlantic coast, and
from southeast New York to coastal Maine.  This rainfall could cause
isolated flooding.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 AM EDT.
