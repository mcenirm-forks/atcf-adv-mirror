SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 65.8 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). A northwest motion is expected
to continue today. Jose will turn toward the north tonight and
Monday, then toward the northeast Monday night, with a slower
forward motion.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the northern coast of
Puerto Rico, and will begin to affect Hispaniola, portions of the
Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the next couple of
days. These swells are likely to produce life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
