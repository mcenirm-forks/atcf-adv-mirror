DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 39.8 North, longitude 67.8 West.  Jose is
moving toward the east-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h), and this
general motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through
this afternoon.  A slow westward motion should begin tonight.  On
the forecast track, the center of Jose is expected to meander off
the coast of southern New England during the next few days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Additional gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km)
from the center.  The Nantucket Airport recently reported a gust to
47 mph (76 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur in the
warning area today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next several days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall accumulations through Friday:

Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod...additional 1 to 2 inches.
Nantucket...additional 2 to 4 inches.
