WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Woods Hole to Sagamore Beach, including Cape Cod
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case within the
next 12 hours.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 39.2 North, longitude 70.0 West.  Jose is
moving toward the northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected to continue
through tonight.  A slow westward motion should begin on Thursday.
On the forecast track, the center of Jose is expected to pass well
to the east of the New Jersey coast today, and pass offshore of
southeastern Massachusetts on Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.

Jose is a large system.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward
up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center. NOAA buoy 44008, located
about 65 miles southeast of Nantucket, recently reported a sustained
wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a gust to 52 mph (83 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area later today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next several days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall accumulations through Thursday:

Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod...1 to 2 inches.
Nantucket...2 to 4 inches.

These rainfall totals could cause isolated flash flooding.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.
