DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 16.6 North, longitude 58.3 West. Jose is moving toward
the west-northwest near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A turn toward the
northwest with a decrease in forward speed is forecast tonight
through the weekend.  On the forecast track, the core of Jose will
pass close or just east of the northern Leeward Islands.

Maximum sustained winds are near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuation in intensity, up or down,
could occur during the next day or so.  Gradual weakening is
expected after that.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 940 mb (27.76 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are likely within the hurricane warning
area on Saturday.  Hurricane conditions are also possible within
the hurricane watch area on Saturday.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the tropical storm warning areas by Saturday
morning. Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical
storm watch area in the northeastern Leeward Islands by Saturday
morning and in the watch area in the Virgin Islands by Saturday
night.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 5 inches in the Leeward Islands from Guadeloupe to Anguilla,
with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Jose is also expected to
produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the Virgin
Islands and Dominica. This rainfall will maintain any ongoing
flooding and may cause additional life-threatening flooding.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in
the hurricane warning areas.  Near the coast,the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands.  These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
