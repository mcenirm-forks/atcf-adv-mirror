* Watch Hill to Hull
* Block Island

* Fenwick Island to Sandy Hook
* Delaware Bay South
* East Rockaway Inlet to Watch Hill

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 24 to
36 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 33.9 North, longitude 71.1 West. Jose is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is expected
to continue during the next day or so.  A turn to the northeast is
expected to occur on Tuesday night.  On the forecast track, the
center of Jose is forecast to pass well offshore of the Outer Banks
of North Carolina today, pass well east of the Delmarva peninsula
tonight and Tuesday, and pass well to the east of the New Jersey
coast on Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area Tuesday night or early Wednesday.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the watch area beginning on Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut,
southern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts, including
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket through Wednesday. Jose is also
expected to produce total rain accumulations up to 2 inches along
the mid-Atlantic coast, and from southeast New York to coastal
Maine. This rainfall could cause isolated flooding.
