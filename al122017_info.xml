system.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 25.9 North, longitude 68.7 West. Jose is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A gradual
turn toward the north is expected later today and on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours.
Jose is forecast to become a hurricane later today.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the northern coasts of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and the Southeast
coast of the United States, and will spread northward along the
Mid-Atlantic coast of the U.S. during the next few days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  For more information, please consult products from your
local weather office.
