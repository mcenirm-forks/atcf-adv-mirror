DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 39.6 North, longitude 68.1 West.  Jose is
stationary, and the system is expected to continue to meander off
the coast of southeast New England for the next several days.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days, and Jose is forecast to become post-tropical on Friday.

Jose is a large system.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend
outward up to 230 miles (370 km) from the center.  A gust to 48 mph
(78 km/h) was recently reported at the Nantucket Airport.  An
unofficial observing site in Vineyard Haven on Martha's Vineyard
recently reported a sustained wind of 39 mph (63 km/h) with a gust
to 52 mph (83 km/h).

The minimum central pressure recently reported by an Air Force
reconnaissance aircraft is 982 mb (29.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur in the
warning area today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next few days.  For more information,
please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall accumulations through Friday:

Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod...additional 1 to 2 inches.
