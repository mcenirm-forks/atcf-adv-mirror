DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Jose
was located near latitude 39.6 North, longitude 68.5 West. Jose is
moving slowly toward the west near 2 mph (4 km/h).  Little motion is
expected for the next 48 hours, and Jose is forecast to meander well
offshore of the coast of southeastern New England during the next
few days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast for the next two days.

Jose is a large system.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward
up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center.  A sustained wind of 41
mph (67 km/h) with a gust to 52 mph (83 km/h) was recently reported
at an unofficial observing site on Block Island.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in the
warning area this morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next couple of days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce additional rainfall totals of
1 to 2 inches across Cape Cod and the offshore islands of Martha's
Vineyard and Nantucket bringing storm total accumulations towards 5
inches.
