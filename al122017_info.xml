DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Jose was located near
latitude 16.4 North, longitude 57.7 West. Jose is moving toward the
west-northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h).  A gradual turn toward the
northwest with a decrease in forward speed is expected during the
next 48 hours.  On the forecast track, the center of Jose will pass
near or east of the northeastern Leeward Islands on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 150 mph (240 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible
for the next day or so, and gradual weakening is expected after
that.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).

The most recent minimum pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane
Hunter plane was 940 mb (27.76 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch
area on Saturday, and tropical storm conditions are expected within
the tropical storm warning areas by Saturday morning. Tropical storm
conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch area in the
northeastern Leeward Islands by Saturday morning and in the watch
area in the Virgin Islands by Saturday night.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 5 inches in the Leeward Islands from Guadeloupe to Anguilla,
with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Jose is also expected to
produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the Virgin
Islands and Dominica. This rainfall will maintain any ongoing
flooding and may cause additional life-threatening flooding.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are expected to affect portions of
the Leeward Islands beginning this afternoon.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
