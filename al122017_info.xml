DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Jose was located
by reconnaissance aircraft near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 62.9
West. Jose is moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and
this motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. On
the forecast track, the core of Jose will continue to move away from
the northern Leeward Islands overnight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts. Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in intensity is expected
overnight, but gradual weakening should begin on Sunday and
continue on Monday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure, based on aircraft data, is
945 mb (27.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, primarily in gusts, are expected
within the tropical storm warning areas through this evening.

STORM SURGE:  Tidal levels will gradually subside over the northern
Leeward Islands tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and will begin
to affect the northern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, and
portions of the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the
next couple of days. These swells are likely to produce
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.
