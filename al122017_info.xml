DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 39.5 North, longitude 67.9 West.  Jose is
stationary, and the system is expected to meander well offshore of
the coast of southeast New England for the next few days.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days, and Jose is forecast to become post-tropical tonight or on
Friday.

Jose is a large system.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward
up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center.  A sustained wind of 38
mph (62 km/h) with a gust to 49 mph (80 km/h) was recently reported
at the Nantucket Airport.  An unofficial observing site in
Vineyard Haven on Martha's Vineyard recently reported a sustained
wind of 37 mph (59 km/h) and a gust to 46 mph (74 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 984 mb (29.06 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in the
warning area through tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next few days.  For more information,
please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall accumulations through Friday:

Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod...additional 1 to 2 inches.
Nantucket...additional 2 to 4 inches.
