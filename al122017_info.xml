WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The Tropical Storm Watch has been discontinued from Fenwick Island,
Delaware to Fire Island Inlet, New York.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Watch Hill to Hull
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* The coast of Long Island from Fire Island Inlet to Port Jefferson
* New Haven to Watch Hill

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within the next 24 to
36 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 34.8 North, longitude 71.1 West. Jose is moving toward
the north near 10 mph (17 km/h), and this motion is expected during
the next day or so.  A turn to the northeast is expected to occur on
Tuesday night.  On the forecast track, the center of Jose is
forecast to pass well offshore of the Delmarva peninsula tonight and
Tuesday, and pass well to the east of the New Jersey coast on
Wednesday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 230 miles
(370 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 977 mb (28.85 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area early Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area beginning Tuesday night.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut,
southern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts, including
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket through Wednesday.  This rainfall
could cause isolated flooding.  Jose is also expected to produce
total rain accumulations up to 1 inch along the mid-Atlantic coast,
and from southeast New York to coastal Maine.

Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
