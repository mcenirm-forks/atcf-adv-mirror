DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM EDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 38.2 North, longitude 70.5 West. Jose is
moving toward the northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue through today with a decrease in
forward speed.  On the forecast track, the center of Jose
is expected to pass well to the east of the New Jersey coast today,
and pass offshore of southeastern Massachusetts Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of
days.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area later this morning.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area beginning today.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall accumulations through Thursday:

Over eastern Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts...1 to 3
inches.
Nantucket and Cape Cod...2 to 4 inches.
Martha's Vineyard...3 to 5 inches.

These rainfall totals could cause isolated flash flooding.
