WATCHES AND WARNINGS

CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

None

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Fenwick Island to Sandy Hook
* Delaware Bay South
* East Rockaway Inlet to Plymouth
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 32.2 North, longitude 71.6 West.  Jose is moving
toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is
expected to continue through Monday night.  A turn toward the
north-northeast is expected on Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Jose is forecast to pass well offshore of the Outer Banks
of North Carolina on Monday, and pass well east of the Delmarva
peninsula Monday night and Tuesday.

Reports from a NOAA and Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft
indicate that the maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Little change in strength is expected during
the next day or so, and Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane
through Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).

The lastest minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance
data is 972 mb (28.71 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL...Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3
to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southern Rhode Island, and
southeast Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket
through Wednesday.  Jose is also expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches along the Mid Atlantic coast, and
from southeast New York to coastal Maine.  This rainfall could cause
isolated flooding.

Next intermediate advisory at 200 AM EDT.
