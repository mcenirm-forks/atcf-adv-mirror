DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 19.2 North, longitude 62.4 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this motion is expected to
continue for the next couple of days. On the forecast track, the
core of Jose will move away from the northern Leeward Islands
tonight.

Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in intensity is expected
overnight, but gradual weakening should begin on Sunday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning areas through this evening.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce up to an inch of additional
rainfall on Anguilla through this evening. This rainfall will
maintain any ongoing flooding.

STORM SURGE:  Tidal levels will gradually subside over the northern
Leeward Islands tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and will begin
to affect the northern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, and
portions of the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the
next couple of days. These swells are likely to produce
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
