DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 20.8 North, longitude 64.5 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this general motion is
expected to continue over the next 24 hours. A slower forward
motion is expected later Monday into Tuesday as Jose begins to make
a turn toward the north.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts. Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, primarily in gusts, are expected
within the tropical storm warning areas through this morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the northern coast of
Puerto Rico, and will begin to affect Hispaniola, portions of the
Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the next couple of
days. These swells are likely to produce life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.
