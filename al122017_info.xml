WATCHES AND WARNINGS

CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 24.9 North, longitude 66.6 West. Jose is
moving toward the west-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this
motion is expected to continue through Friday, followed by a turn
to the northwest on Saturday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some restrengthening is forecast to begin on
Friday, and Jose will likely become a hurricane again by the
weekend.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the northern coasts of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and the Southeast
coast of the United States, and will spread northward along the
Mid-Atlantic coast of the U.S. during the next few days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  For more information, please consult products from your
local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.
