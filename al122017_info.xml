1100 AM EDT Sun Sep 17 2017

...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS FIND JOSE STRONGER...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS EXPECTED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES...


SUMMARY OF 1100 AM EDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...31.0N 71.9W
ABOUT 355 MI...575 KM SE OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA
ABOUT 425 MI...685 KM W OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...967 MB...28.56 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests from North Carolina northward to New England on the east
coast of the United States should monitor the progress of this
system.  Tropical storm watches may be needed for portions of this
area during the next day or so.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 31.0 North, longitude 71.9 West. Jose is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion is expected
through Tuesday.  On the forecast track, the center of Jose is
expected to remain offshore of the U.S. east coast.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 90 mph (150 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible over
the next couple of days, but Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane
through Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185
miles (295 km).

The minimum central pressure based on data from the Air Force
Hurricane Hunters is 967 mb (28.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.
