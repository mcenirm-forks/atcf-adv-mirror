For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 39.4 North, longitude 68.6 West.  Jose is
moving toward the northeast near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general
motion with a decrease in forward speed is expected through tonight.
A slow westward motion should begin by Thursday night.  On the
forecast track, the center of Jose is expected to meander off the
coast of southern New England during the next few days.

Reports from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicate
that the maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph
(110 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during
the next couple of days.

Jose is a large tropical cyclone.  Tropical-storm-force winds
extend outward up to 230 miles (370 km) from the center.  NOAA buoy
44008, located about 65 miles southeast of Nantucket, recently
reported a sustained wind of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a gust to 49 mph
(80 km/h).

The latest minimum central pressure measure by reconnaissance
aircraft is 979 mb (28.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area tonight and continue through Thursday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next several days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall accumulations through Thursday:

Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod...1 to 2 inches.
Nantucket...2 to 4 inches.

These rainfall totals could cause isolated flash flooding.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.
