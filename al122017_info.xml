DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 61.9 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 14 mph (23 km/h).  A continued northwest motion
is expected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast track,
the core of Jose will continue to pass north of the northern
Leeward Islands through this evening.

Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Gradual weakening is expected to occur over
the next couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical
storm warning areas through this evening.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
2 to 4 inches in the portions of Northern Leeward Islands, with
with isolated maximum amounts of 6 inches. This rainfall will
maintain any ongoing flooding and may cause additional
life-threatening flooding.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in
the tropical storm warning areas.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and will begin
to affect the northern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, and
portions of the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the
next couple of days. These swells could cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
