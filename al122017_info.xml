DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 19.8 North, longitude 63.4 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this motion is expected to
continue through Sunday. A slower forward motion is expected
on Monday as Jose makes a turn toward the north.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts. Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, primarily in gusts, are expected
within the tropical storm warning areas overnight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, and will begin
to affect the northern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, and
portions of the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the
next couple of days. These swells are likely to produce
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.
