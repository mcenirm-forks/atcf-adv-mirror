SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 66.9 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). This motion is expected to
continue tonight with a slowing of forward speed on Monday. Jose
will begin turning toward the northeast Monday night, followed by a
more eastward motion on Tuesday. On the forecast track, Jose will
remain well to the east of the Bahamas for the next couple of days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 120 mph (195
km/h) with higher gusts.  Jose is a category 3 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional weakening is
forecast, but Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane during the next
couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles
(260 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 956 mb (28.23 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
northern coast of Puerto Rico, and will begin to affect Hispaniola,
portions of the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the
next couple of days. These swells are likely to produce high surf
and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.
