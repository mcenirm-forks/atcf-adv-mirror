DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Jose was located near
latitude 17.2 North, longitude 59.6 West. Jose is moving toward the
west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h).  A west-northwest to northwest
motion is expected during the next couple of days.  On the forecast
track, the core of Jose will pass close to or just east of the
northern Leeward Islands later today.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 150 mph (240 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuation in intensity,
up or down, could occur during the next 24 hours.  Afterward,
gradual weakening is expected to occur.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure based on observations from
the Air Force Hurricane Hunters is 940 mb (27.76 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the hurricane
warning area today.  Hurricane conditions are also possible within
the hurricane watch area today.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within the tropical storm warning areas by this morning.
Tropical storm conditions are possible in the tropical storm watch
area in the northeastern Leeward Islands by this morning and in the
watch area in the Virgin Islands by tonight.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 5 inches in the Leeward Islands from Guadeloupe to Anguilla,
with isolated maximum amounts of 8 inches. Jose is also expected to
produce total rain accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the Virgin
Islands and Dominica. This rainfall will maintain any ongoing
flooding and may cause additional life-threatening flooding.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast in
the hurricane warning areas.  Near the coast, the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands.  These swells are expected to continue for a couple
of days, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
