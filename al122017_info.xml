DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 PM EDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 37.9 North, longitude 70.8 West. Jose is
moving toward the northeast near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general
motion is expected to continue for the next day or two with a
decrease in forward speed. On the forecast track, the center of
Jose is expected to pass well to the east of the New Jersey coast on
Wednesday, and pass offshore of southeastern Massachusetts by
Thursday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some gradual weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 220 miles (350 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 973 mb (28.74 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in the
warning area early Wednesday.  Tropical storm conditions are
possible in the watch area beginning early tomorrow.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast.  These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL: Jose is expected to produce the following additional
rainfall accumulations through Thursday:

Over eastern Rhode Island and southeast Massachusetts...1 to 3
inches.
Nantucket and Cape Cod...2 to 4 inches.
Martha's Vineyard...3 to 5 inches.

These rainfall totals could cause isolated flash flooding.
