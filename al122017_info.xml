...TROPICAL STORM WATCH ISSUED FOR A PORTION OF THE MID-ATLANTIC
AND NEW ENGLAND COAST...
...DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS EXPECTED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF
THE UNITED STATES...


SUMMARY OF 500 PM EDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect from Fenwick Island, Delaware,
to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, including Delaware Bay South, and from
East Rockaway Inlet, New York, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including
Long Island Sound, Block Island, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Fenwick Island to Sandy Hook
* Delaware Bay South
* East Rockaway Inlet to Plymouth
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard
* Nantucket

Interests elsewhere along the U.S. east coast from North Carolina
northward to New England should monitor the progress of Jose.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 31.5 North, longitude 71.8 West. Jose is moving toward
the north near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is expected
during the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, Jose is
forecast to remain offshore of the U.S. east coast.

Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some fluctuations in intensity are possible over the next
couple of days, but Jose is forecast to remain a hurricane through
Tuesday.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 967 mb (28.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch
area by Tuesday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
and much of the U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause
dangerous surf and rip current conditions for the next several
days in these areas.  For more information, please consult products
from your local weather office.

RAINFALL...Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3
to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southern Rhode Island, and
southeast Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket
through Wednesday. Jose is also expected to produce total rain
accumulations of 1 to 3 inches along the Mid Atlantic coast, and
from southeast New York to coastal Maine. This rainfall could cause
isolated flooding and flash flooding.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM EDT.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM EDT.
