DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 PM AST (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 39.6 North, longitude 68.1 West.  Jose is
drifting westward near 2 mph (4 km/h).  The system is expected to
meander well offshore of the coast of southeastern New England
during the next few days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days,
and Jose is expected to become post-tropical on Friday.

Jose is a large system.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward
up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center.  A sustained wind of 40
mph (65 km/h) with a gust to 59 mph (94 km/h) was reported at the
Nantucket airport within the past few hours.  An unofficial
observing site in Vineyard Haven on Martha's Vineyard has reported
a sustained wind of 39 mph (63 km/h) with a gust to 47 mph
(76 km/h) within the past hour.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in the
warning area through tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next couple of days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches across Cape Cod and the offshore
islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.

Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.
