DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Jose
was located near latitude 39.5 North, longitude 69.4 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the southwest near 2 mph (4
km/h). Jose is expected to meander off the coast of New England for
the next several days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in the
warning area through this afternoon.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next couple of days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

Rainfall: Jose is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of up to one inch across Cape Cod and the offshore
Islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket through early Saturday.
When including rain that has already fallen, storm total
accumulations could reach 6 inches on Nantucket.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
