HURRICANE AGAIN...


SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...26.5N 69.4W
ABOUT 360 MI...575 KM NE OF THE SOUTHEASTERN BAHAMAS
ABOUT 485 MI...785 KM SW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests from North Carolina northward to New England on the east
coast of the United States should monitor the progress of this
system.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 26.5 North, longitude 69.4 West. Jose is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  This general
motion is expected today, follow by a turn to the north-northwest
by late Saturday and toward the north on Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours. An
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently en route to
obtain a better wind speed estimate.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the northern coasts of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and the southeast
coast of the United States, and will spread northward along the
Mid-Atlantic coast of the U.S. during the next few days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  For more information, please consult products from your
local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.
