DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 64.0 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 15 mph (24 km/h) and this motion is expected to
continue today. A slower forward motion is expected on Monday as
Jose makes a turn toward the north.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts. Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next
48 hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions, primarily in gusts, are expected
within the tropical storm warning areas through this morning.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the northern coast of
Puerto Rico, and will begin to affect Hispaniola, portions of the
Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the next couple of
days. These swells are likely to produce life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
