...JOSE MOVING NORTHWESTWARD...
...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER EN ROUTE TO INVESTIGATE...


SUMMARY OF 1100 AM EDT...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...28.8N 72.2W
ABOUT 480 MI...775 KM SSE OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA
ABOUT 500 MI...810 KM WSW OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 320 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...982 MB...29.00 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.

Interests from North Carolina northward to New England on the east
coast of the United States should monitor the progress of this
system.  Tropical storm watches may be needed for portions of this
area during the next day or two.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 28.8 North, longitude 72.2 West.  Jose is moving
toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A turn toward the
north-northwest and then toward the north is expected by tonight,
and a northward motion should continue through Monday.  On the
forecast track, the center of Jose will move over the western
Atlantic Ocean between the east coast of the United States and
Bermuda through Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 982 mb (29.00 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda, the Bahamas,
the northern coasts of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, and much of the
U.S. east coast. These swells are likely to cause dangerous surf and
rip current conditions for the next several days in these areas.
For more information, please consult products from your local
weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.
