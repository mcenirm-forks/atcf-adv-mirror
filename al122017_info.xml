DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 800 AM AST (1200 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Jose was located
near latitude 21.2 North, longitude 65.3 West. Jose is moving toward
the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h) and this general motion is
expected to continue over the next 24 hours. A slower forward motion
is expected later Monday into Tuesday as Jose begins to make a turn
toward the north.

Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts. Jose is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Gradual weakening is forecast during the next
couple of days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160
miles (260 km). NOAA Buoy 41043 recently reported a one-minute
sustained wind of 90 mph and a peak wind gust of 110 mph.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 944 mb (27.88 inches).
NOAA Buoy 41043 recently reported a minimum pressure of 963 mb
(28.45 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting portions of the
Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the northern coast of
Puerto Rico, and will begin to affect Hispaniola, portions of the
Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands over the next couple of
days. These swells are likely to produce life-threatening surf and
rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local
weather office.
