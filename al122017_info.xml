SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

* Woods Hole to Sagamore Beach, including Cape Cod
* Block Island
* Martha's Vineyard

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Jose was
located near latitude 39.6 North, longitude 67.9 West.  Jose is
currently stationary, and the system is expected to meander well
offshore of the coast of southeastern New England during the next
few days.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with
higher gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple
of days, and Jose is expected to become post-tropical on Friday.

Jose is a large system.  Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward
up to 205 miles (335 km) from the center.  A sustained wind of 39
mph (63 km/h) with a gust to 52 mph (83 km/h) was recently reported
at the Nantucket airport.  An unofficial observing site in Vineyard
Haven on Martha's Vineyard just reported a sustained wind of 42
mph (69 km/h) with a gust to 52 mph (83 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue in the
warning area through tonight.

SURF:  Swells generated by Jose are affecting Bermuda and much of
the U.S. east coast and will likely cause dangerous surf and rip
current conditions during the next couple of days.  For more
information, please consult products from your local weather office.

RAINFALL:  Jose is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of 1 to 2 inches across Cape Cod and the offshore
islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.
