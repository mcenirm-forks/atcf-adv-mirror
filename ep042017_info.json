Dora is moving\ntoward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h.  This general motion\nwith some decrease in forward speed is expected today and Wednesday,\nwith a turn toward the west expected by Thursday. On the forecast\ntrack, the center of Dora is expected to pass just north of Socorro\nIsland later today, and remain well south of the Baja California\npeninsula.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 75 mph (120 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast during the\nnext 48 hours, and Dora could become a remnant low by Thursday.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles\n(75 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.24 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of the\ncoast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread\nnorthwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the\nsouthern Baja California peninsula today through Wednesday.  These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.
