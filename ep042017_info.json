Dora is moving\ntoward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general motion\nwith some decrease in forward speed is expected today and Wednesday,\nwith a turn toward the west expected by Thursday. On the forecast\ntrack, the center of Dora is expected to pass over or just north of\nSocorro Island later today, and remain well south of the Baja\nCalifornia peninsula.\n\nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)\nwith higher gusts.  Weakening is expected during the next couple of\ndays, and Dora could become a remnant low by Thursday.\n\nSatellite data indicate that Dora is a small tropical cyclone.\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds only extend outward up to 45\nmiles (75 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of the\ncoast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread\nnorthwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the\nsouthern Baja California peninsula today through Wednesday.  These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.\n\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n-------------\nNext complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.\n\n$$\nForecaster Blake\n\nNNNN",
