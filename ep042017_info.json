Dora is\nmoving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h) and this\ngeneral motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected over\nthe next couple of days. On the forecast track, the center of Dora\nis expected to pass over or just north of Socorro Island on\nTuesday, and remain well south of the Baja California peninsula.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher\ngusts. Gradual weakening is expected during the next 48 hours, and\nDora is forecast to become a tropical storm Tuesday night or\nWednesday morning.\n\nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the\ncenter and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles\n(130 km).\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).\n\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nSURF:  Swells generated by Dora are affecting portions of the\ncoast of southwest Mexico.  These swells are expected to spread\nnorthwestward and begin affecting portions of the coast of the\nsouthern Baja California peninsula by early Tuesday.  These\nswells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\nconditions.
