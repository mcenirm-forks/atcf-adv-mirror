products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 22.2 North, longitude 106.6 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the north-northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A slower
northward or north-northwestward motion is expected during the next
day or so.  On the forecast track, the center of Pilar is forecast
to move along or just west of the coast of the Mexican states of
Nayarit and Sinaloa until it dissipates in a day or so.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast, and Pilar is expected to
become a tropical depression later today and dissipate by Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
north of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3
to 7 inches with possible isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches over
the western portions of the Mexican states of Nayarit, southern
Sinaloa, and southwestern Durango through Tuesday.  This rainfall
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in a portion of the
warning area.  These conditions are expected to diminish later
today.
