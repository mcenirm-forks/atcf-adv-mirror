DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK

At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 105.3 West. Pilar is
moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h), and a north to
north-northwest track is expected to continue through the weekend.
On the forecast track, Pilar will move over or very near the
coast of Jalisco on Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 40 mph (65 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is likely tonight
and on Sunday before Pilar nears the coast.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3
to 6 inches with possible isolated maximum of 15 inches over the
western portions of the Mexican states of Michoacan, Colima, western
Jalisco and Nayarit through Monday.   This rainfall may cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides

WIND: Tropical Storm conditions are expected to begin within the
southern portion of the warning area tonight or early Sunday,
and gradually spread northward along the Mexican coast on Sunday and
Monday.
