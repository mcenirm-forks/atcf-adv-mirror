DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 21.9 North, longitude 106.5 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A slower northward or
north-northwestward motion is expected during the next day or two.
On the forecast track, the center of Pilar is forecast to move along
or just west of the coast of the Mexican states of Nayarit and
Sinaloa during the next 48 hours.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Gradual weakening is forecast, and Pilar is expected to
become a tropical depression on Monday and dissipate on Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
north of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3
to 7 inches with possible isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches over
the western portions of the Mexican states of Nayarit and southern
Sinaloa through Monday night.  This rainfall could cause
life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in a portion of the
warning area.  These conditions will gradually spread northward
along the Mexican coast on Monday.
