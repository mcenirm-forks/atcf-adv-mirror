A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 106.9 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A slower
northward or north-northwestward motion is expected during the next
day or so.  On the forecast track, the center of Pilar is forecast
to move along or just west of the coast of the Mexican states of
Nayarit and Sinaloa until it dissipates in a day or so.

Maximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast, and Pilar is expected to
become a tropical depression later today and dissipate by Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km),
mainly to the north of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 7 inches with possible isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches
over the western portions of the Mexican states of Nayarit, southern
Sinaloa, and southwestern Durango through Tuesday.  This rainfall
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.

WIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in a portion of the
warning area.  These conditions will diminish later today.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.
