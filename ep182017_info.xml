DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Pilar
was located near latitude 22.8 North, longitude 107.0 West.  The
depression is moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h)
and this general motion is expected to continue for the next day or
so until Pilar dissipates.  On the forecast track, the center of
Pilar is expected to remain just offshore of the coasts of the
Mexican states of Nayarit and Sinaloa today.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Pilar is
expected to become a remnant low later today and dissipate by
Tuesday.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce total rain accumulations of
3 to 7 inches with possible isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches
over the western portions of the Mexican states of Nayarit, southern
Sinaloa, and southwestern Durango through Tuesday.  This rainfall
could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.
