DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 106.0 West. Pilar is
moving toward the north-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A slower
northward motion is expected for the next two days.  Along the
forecast track, the center of Pilar is forecast to move along or
just west of the coast of Jalisco today and close to or over the
Islas Marias and the coast of Nayarit on Monday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with
higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast during the next 48
hours and Pilar is expected to become a remnant low by Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3
to 7 inches with possible isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches over
the western portions of the Mexican states of Michoacan, Colima,
Jalisco, and Nayarit, and southern Sinaloa through Monday night.
This rainfall could cause life-threatening flash floods and
mudslides.
