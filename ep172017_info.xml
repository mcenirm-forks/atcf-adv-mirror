* Los Barriles to Todos Santos

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 24 hours.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was
located near latitude 21.1 North, longitude 111.1 West. Norma is
moving toward the northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h).  The tropical
storm is expected to turn toward the west-northwest at about the
same forward speed during the next two days.  On the forecast
track, the center of Norma will move southwest of the Baja
California peninsula by Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours and it is
anticipated that Norma will become a tropical depression by Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce additional rainfall
accumulations of an inch of less over the southern portion of the
Mexican state of Baja California Sur.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
tonight or early Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur and will continue
into late Monday or Tuesday next week.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
