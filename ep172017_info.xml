SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Los Barriles to Todos Santos

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* North of Todos Santos to Cabo San Lazaro

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests in the remainder of the Baja California Peninsula should
monitor the progress of Norma.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 900 AM MDT (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 19.3 North, longitude 110.1 West. Norma has been
nearly stationary, but a slow northward motion should begin later
today and continue through Monday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Norma will move near or to the west of the southern Baja
California Peninsula on Sunday and Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).  The Mexican Navy station in Isla Socorro recently
reported a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/hr) and a gust of 54 mph
(87 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 8 to 12 inches over the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Baja California Sur, with isolated maximum amounts in excess of 20
inches possible. These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening
flash floods.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by early Sunday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by late Sunday or early Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur and will continue
into early next week. These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Next intermediate advisory at 1200 PM MDT.
