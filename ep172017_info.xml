NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP172017

...TROPICAL STORM WARNING ISSUED FOR THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE
BAJA CALIFORNIA PENINSULA...


SUMMARY OF 300 AM MDT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.0N 110.2W
ABOUT 55 MI...85 KM ENE OF SOCORRO ISLAND
ABOUT 270 MI...435 KM S OF CABO SAN LUCAS MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...75 MPH...120 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...STATIONARY
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...987 MB...29.15 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:

The government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for
the Baja California peninsula from Los Barriles southward around the
peninsula to Todos Santos, and has issued a Tropical Storm Watch
north of Todos Santos to Santa Fe.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Los Barriles to Todos Santos

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* North of Todos Santos to Santa Fe


A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests in the remainder of the Baja California Peninsula should
monitor the progress of Norma.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products
issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 AM MDT (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 19.0 North, longitude 110.2 West. Norma has been
nearly stationary, but a slow northward motion should begin
later today and continue through Sunday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day
or two.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Norma will begin affecting portions
of the coast of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur on
Saturday and continue into early next week. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by early Sunday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by late Sunday or early Monday.

RAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 8 to 12 inches over the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Baja California Sur, with isolated maximum amounts in excess of 20
inches possible. These rainfall amounts may produce life threatening
flash floods.

NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 AM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 AM MDT.
