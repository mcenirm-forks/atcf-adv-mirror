Interests in the remainder of the Baja California Peninsula should
monitor the progress of Norma.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Norma was located
near latitude 19.4 North, longitude 110.1 West. Norma is moving
toward the north near 2 mph (4 km/h). The hurricane should continue
moving toward the north or north-northwest during the next couple
days at a slightly faster forward speed. On the forecast track, the
center of Norma will move near or to the west of the southern Baja
California Peninsula on Sunday and Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90
miles (150 km). The Mexican Navy station in Isla Socorro recently
reported a sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/hr) and a gust of 56 mph
(91 km/h).

The estimated minimum central pressure is 985 mb (29.09 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 8 to 12 inches over the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Baja California Sur, with isolated maximum amounts in excess of 20
inches possible. These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening
flash floods.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by early Sunday, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by late Sunday or early Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur and will continue
into early next week. These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY

Next complete advisory at 300 PM MDT.
