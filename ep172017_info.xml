SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:

A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Los Barriles to Todos Santos

A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* North of Todos Santos to Cabo San Lazaro

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests in the remainder of the Baja California Peninsula should
monitor the progress of Norma.

For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 300 PM MDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was
located near latitude 19.7 North, longitude 110.2 West. Norma is
moving toward the north near 3 mph (6 km/h). The tropical storm
should continue moving toward the north-northwest or northwest
during the next couple days at a slightly faster forward speed. On
the forecast track, the center of Norma will move near or to the
west of the southern Baja California Peninsula on Sunday and Monday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 65 mph (100 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional weakening is forecast during the
next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center. The Mexican Navy station in Isla Socorro recently
reported a sustained wind of 35 mph (56 km/hr) and a gust of 55 mph
(89 km/h).

The minimum central pressure measured by the Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches over the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Baja California Sur, with isolated maximum amounts up to 8 inches.
These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash floods.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by Sunday morning, making outside
preparations difficult or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area by late Sunday or early Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur and will continue
into early next week. These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 600 PM MDT.
Next complete advisory at 900 PM MDT.
