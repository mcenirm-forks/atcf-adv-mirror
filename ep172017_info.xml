For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1200 PM MDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was
located near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 110.8 West. Norma is
moving toward the north-northwest near 6 mph (9 km/h). On the
forecast track, the center of Norma will move just west of the Baja
California peninsula by Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Some weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours and Norma
is expected to become a tropical depression by late Monday or
Tuesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 1 to 2 inches over the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Baja California Sur, with isolated maximum amounts up to 4 inches.
These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash floods.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
tonight or early Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur and will continue
into early next week.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
