DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 1200 AM MDT (0600 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was
located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 110.2 West.  Norma is
moving toward the north near 5 mph (7 km/h).  The tropical storm is
forecast to turn toward the north-northwest this morning, followed
by a turn toward the northwest by Monday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Norma will move near or just west of the southern Baja
California Peninsula today and Monday.

Maximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Gradual weakening is expected for the next 48 hours.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 989 mb (29.21 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches over the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Baja California Sur, with isolated maximum amounts up to 8 inches.
These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash floods.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by this afternoon.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the watch area tonight or early
Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur and will continue
into early next week.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Next complete advisory at 300 AM MDT.
