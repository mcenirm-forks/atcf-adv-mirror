DISCUSSION AND 48-HOUR OUTLOOK
------------------------------
At 600 AM MDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Norma was
located near latitude 20.7 North, longitude 110.5 West.  Norma is
moving toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  A turn
toward the northwest is expected on Monday.  On the forecast track,
the center of Norma will move just west of the Baja California
peninsula today and Monday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is expected through Monday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL:  Norma is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations
of 2 to 4 inches over the southern portion of the Mexican state of
Baja California Sur, with isolated maximum amounts up to 8 inches.
These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash floods.

WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the
coast within the warning area by this afternoon.  Tropical storm
conditions are possible within the watch area tonight or early
Monday.

SURF:  Swells generated by Norma are affecting portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur and will continue
into early next week.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
